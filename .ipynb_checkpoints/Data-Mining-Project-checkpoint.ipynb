    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Times is one of the world’s most circulated newspapers with a history dating back to 1851. A lot has changed in society during the 150 plus year history of The Times, but few things have gained as much attention as the portrayal of women in media. Ever since the recent gender equality discussion (Carlsen, A., Salam, M., Miller, C.C., Lu, D. Ngu, A. Patel, J.K., & Wichter, Z., 2018) change seems to have sped up. It's become increasingly important for newspapers to be mindful of the way they represent women, in order to stay relevant and, perhaps most importantly, not suffer backlash resulting in damage to their image and credibility."

    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "With the recent surge in coverage of media and its treatment of women, the New York Times is interested in looking at the optics of their own publications as it relates to gender. Looking back through history, they are interested in their difference in coverage of male and female subjects, as well as how this relates to the gender of the author.\n",
    "Our first inquiry relates to how journalists affect the content and coverage that they deliver. According to a study by Armstrong, “the gender of the newswriter can be linked to gender portrayals within news stories.” (Armstrong, C.L., 2008) It suggests that the gender of selected sources and individuals that get covered is related to that of the journalist. Looking at NYT’s publications, we will examine if such a correlation can be found and how this might affect hiring decisions in the future.\n",
    "Our second question pertains to the representation of women subjects in articles and other news items. According to Collins, Rebecca L. (Sex Roles; New York Vol. 64, Iss. 3-4) women are under-represented across a range of media and settings, including newspapers. Secondly when they are portrayed it is often in a negative manner. We want to research how the representation of women, in articles published by New York Times, has changed over the last 150 years. By doing so we can help NYT understand where they stand right now as it relates to gender representation, and how they have progressed over the years."

    "## Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is collected through the New York Times \"Archive API\" in the form of JSON files which we convert to CSV files externally. The API provides distinct data such as lead paragraphs, titles, authors and occasionally abstracts from articles dating back to 1851. Rather than looking at the entire body of work we have decided to sample the article data for this pilot study. We will only gather data from the time period 1970 to 2017, mainly because of computation reasons. In this sample we will collect all the articles published during March, June and September to keep down the amount of articles. Although sampling the data heavily we still have a dataset containing X articles. To keep computation time and amount of requests down we have \"cached\" the data by saving it to a file which we host at RANDOM CDN."

Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year Award from the City of Minneapolis; and numerous awards from the hospitality, travel and marketing industries. He was active in the Masons (33 degree) and Shriners, and Sigma Phi Epsilon national fraternity, from which he received the Order of the Golden Heart. Survivors include his beloved wife of sixty years, Arleen; daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson and husband Dr. Glen Nelson, and daughter Barbara Carlson Gage and husband Edwin ''Skip'' Gage; grandchildren Diana Nelson and husband Marius Muresanu, Curtis Nelson and wife Margie, Wendy Nelson, Daisy Mitchell, Geoffrey Gage and wife Kelly, Scott Gage and wife Gina, Christine Gage, and Richard Gage and wife Britt; six great-grandchildren; brother Warren and wife Jane; sisters-in-law Elaine Carlson and Hazel Carlson; and numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson was preceded in death by brothers Ken and Dean; a sister, Aileen Miller; and granddaughter, Juliet Nelson. Mr. Carlson will be remembered not only for the professional successes he achieved, but also for his love of family and community, and the integrity he demonstrated in everything he did. He lived a full, wonderful life and was an inspiration to his family, friends and colleagues. His sense of humor, guidance and wisdom will be missed. His immediate family, his extended family, and his corporate family around the world have pledged to follow his advice: ''Do not what I did, but seek what I sought.'' The funeral will be Tuesday, February 23, at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church, 511 Groveland, Minneapolis. Visitation is Monday, February 22, at the church. Contributions in his memory may be made to the University of Minnesota, Curtis L. Carlson School of Management and/or Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church.

Such are the vagaries of living in a car culture. But on Friday night, the theater was packed for two fresh and vigorous premieres on a program billed as Mark Morris Dance Group and Yo-Yo Ma. The pieces are very different. In the Boston premiere of ''Falling Down Stairs,'' which Mr. Morris has adapted from choreography for a film, his dancers actually do fall down steps and perform a staircase dance that Bill (Bojangles) Robinson would admire. In the world premiere, ''The Argument,'' three couples in search of a marriage counselor finally make peace. The latter work, which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov as a guest, was the crowd pleaser; it is clever and witty. But ''Falling Down Stairs,'' more legible in its broad strokes of movement, is richly textured and one of Mr. Morris's best works in years, largely because it is so original.\n"

Senators and representatives assail each other in public, but voters wonder whether they then retire to their racquetball courts, watering holes and dinner parties to make mutually beneficial deals, especially when it comes to rules on ethics and gifts. But today the clubby old atmosphere of Congress is looked on with something approaching nostalgia. The public seems more worried these days by its culture of partisanship, pettiness, revenge and the resulting paralysis. Some lawmakers have begun talking like apostles for a new 12-step program to restore healing and civility. You would think politicians would not need lessons in listening to each other. But after a year of hectoring over President Clinton's personal conduct, they are not a bad idea. This month House members plan a return to Hershey, Pa., where they held a retreat two years ago. This time they have invited John Hume, the Catholic leader who won a Nobel prize for helping to bury ancient ethnic hatreds in Northern Ireland. In similar fashion, the Senate seems to look back on its closed session in the Clinton impeachment trial as a kind of epiphany, or at least a group therapy session. Senators get misty-eyed about discovering their own humanity and want to keep the spirit alive, though the impeachment votes were overwhelmingly partisan.\n",

After a fourth-best lead, the number of higher cards in the other three hands can be determined by subtracting the size of the spot card led from 11. On the diagramed deal, for example, East can calculate from the opening lead that South has no club higher than the six. If he does not wish to use the rule, East can work out that West must have the king-jack-nine, the only missing cards above the six. But on the diagramed deal from a money game at the Regency Club (15 East 67th Street, Manhattan) East did not stop to work this out. When he played the ace on the first trick instead of the 10, the defense became difficult.\n",

      "The promise of a super-fast, highly reliable Internet moved a step closer to reality last week when three dozen universities across the United States were linked to a new national research network that moves data 1,600 times faster than the T-1 lines that universities and businesses use today. The benefits of the new data pipeline, known as the Abilene Network, were highlighted Wednesday night in a ceremony at Union Station in Washington that included a demonstration of remote surgery in which doctors collaborated over the network while hundreds of miles apart. In addition to telemedicine, applications that require huge data pipelines include interactive distance learning, digital libraries, multimedia entertainment and even tornado forecasting. ''It's the difference between motion pictures and flipping through the pages of a book,'' said Guy K. Cook, vice president of Internet services for Qwest Communications of Denver, one of the companies that helped develop the network. Spanning more than 10,000 miles, the $500 million Abilene Network links 37 universities at 2.4 billion bits, or gigabits, a second. One of a half- dozen next-generation Internet networks developed by the privately financed Internet 2 consortium and the Federal Government in recent years, Abilene is faster than all but a few highly experimental Government networks. By the end of 1999, it is expected to link more than 60 research institutions. For now, access to Abilene is limited to academics and other professionals, but experts say that consumers will begin realizing its benefits in a few years. The professional and research applications demonstrated Wednesday night will open the way for technologies that will, for example, enable home computer users to rent and view films on line. But the most important long-term impact is the promise of a thoroughly reliable Internet, said Douglas Van Houweling of the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development, which oversees Internet 2 projects. ''Right now, since the Internet is a best-effort network, you can't be sure when you log on and use it whether or not it's going to work very well,'' he said. ''If the Internet is going to fulfill its promises for the future, you have to be able to count on it.'' Named after a seminal railroad of the 1860's, the Abilene Network was developed with an investment of $500 million in equipment and services from Qwest, Cisco Systems Inc., Nortel Networks and Indiana University.\n",

      "FYBISH-Peggy Romano. On January 26, 1999, at her Manhattan home. Dearly loved wife and companion since 1971 of Stephen Fybish. Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.\n",

A longtime trustee of The Hunter College Foundation, she supported her alma mater throughout her long and productive life and served as a role model to generations of Hunter students-especially women-who aspired to a career in science. She was instrumental in the development of a host of drugs to combat some of the most virulent diseases known, and she was active in the professional community: she was president of the American Association for Cancer Research, a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, among others. Though officially retired for a number of years, she continued to teach and conduct research. She received more than 25 honorary doctorates, including one from Hunter College, which will always remember her for both her scientific accomplishments and her generosity to her College. Allan H. Kurtzman, Chair Floria V. Lasky, Co-Chair The Hunter College Foundation ELION-Gertrude B. The entire Hunter College community is deeply saddened by the loss of Gertrude Elion, a 1937 graduate of Hunter who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988. During a long and distinguished career as a pioneering research scientist, she helped develop drugs to combat leukemia, septic shock, malaria, organ transplantation rejection, and AIDS. A member of the Hunter College Hall of Fame, she was awarded the President's Medal in 1970. When she received an honorary doctorate from Hunter in 1989, the Burroughs Wellcome Company, the pharmaceutical company where she had worked since 1944, established a scholarship endowment fund in her honor. The fund assists Hunter women pursuing careers in science. Dr. Elion will be remembered for her generosity and warmth in working with students as well as for her many contributions to mankind.

      "Olusegun Obasanjo, a former general, will be the next president of Nigeria, according to preliminary election results. His selection reflects the complexities of power in Nigeria today. When the country's current leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, took over last June, he promised a transition to civilian rule after 15 years of disaster under general after general. Mr. Abubakar has kept his promise. But the transition is incomplete. Military officers, who largely bankrolled Mr. Obasanjo's candidacy, will continue to loom over his government. Mr. Obasanjo will have to break with them to have any success in improving life in Africa's most populous nation. General Abubakar took power after the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, one of the most corrupt and certainly the most despotic of Nigeria's recent military rulers. Their thievery and mismanagement turned Nigeria, one of the world's richest nations during the oil boom of the 1970's, into one of the world's poorest. General Abacha snuffed out political life in this once-vibrant country, jailing many of his rivals, including General Obasanjo.\n",

Today, as the Linuxworld trade show opens in San Jose, Calif., the program has begun to pose real competition to the Unix and Windows NT operating systems that dominate the market for business computing.

      "People who covet their neighbors' goods always overestimate how much happier they would be if they got them. This rule is particularly true when applied to spouses, and perhaps giant TV satellite dishes. But it also works for Presidential primaries. California has long been dissatisfied with its June primary, and envious of the states that vote earlier. California regards itself as the Land of the Future, but picking Presidential nominees after most of the candidates have already crashed and burned made people feel non-cutting-edge, a retro electorate. So the state legislature, after some struggle, moved the date to March 7. You would not believe how happy the California politicians think this is going to make them. The place where a State Senate campaign can very easily cost $1 million believes it is going to turn into a political New Hampshire. ''The voters will get a chance to meet the candidates on a retail basis,'' the state Republican chairman told his party convention here last weekend, calling up visions of George W. Bush shaking hands at Orange County malls while Elizabeth Dole hits a string of house parties in Chico.\n",

In the face of a new wave of political repression in China, President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright must do more than repeat stale complaints and then change the subject to trade. Americans will not support a policy of engagement and improved relations with China if the price is American inaction on human rights abuses. Ms. Albright traveled to China this week just days after the State Department published a withering report on repression in China. It found that in 1998 Chinese leaders broke their promises to respect international human rights conventions, held thousands of political critics and religious activists in prison, tortured detainees and tightened restrictions on the press.

In assembly line fashion, the eye doctor examines each child. The aim is to seek the earliest sign of a condition known as retinopathy of prematurity, resulting from abnormal blood vessel growth, and to use a laser to prevent a detached retina, which can cause blindness. The octuplets were born nearly four months before the mother's due date of April 1. Like other infants born many weeks too early, they are at high risk of developing retinopathy in both eyes.\n",

      "In trying to explain why fruits and vegetables help prevent cancer, some researchers cite flavonoids, which are chemical ingredients that inhibit cancer cell growth. But a new study suggests that tangeretin, a flavonoid in citrus fruits and certain processed foods and dietary supplements, may sometimes be harmful because it negates the benefits of tamoxifen, the breast cancer drug. The finding came as a surprise, since in vitro studies showed that tangeretin acted like tamoxifen to inhibit mammary cancer cells. Researchers from the University Hospital in Ghent, Belgium, wanted to see if tangeretin could amplify tamoxifen's therapeutic effect in mice with mammary cancer. Their study was published last month in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute. One group of the 80 mice drank water with tamoxifen, one drank water with tangeretin, one drank water with both substances and the fourth group served as a control. The tamoxifen group had significantly less tumor growth than the others and lived an average of 56 weeks, compared with just 14 weeks for the tangeretin-tamoxifen group.\n",

(See Thomas Mann's ''Lotte in Weimar.'') Schubert was just one song composer in the thrall of the great man's poetry. The ''Erlkonig'' inspired not only Schubert's famous teen-age masterpiece but a very different and equally masterly version by Carl Loewe as well. Schubert had approached Goethe early on, seeking his imprimatur, and was ignored. Rejection, however, did not keep him from turning to the same body of poetry again and again.\n",

Most readers are undoubtedly familiar with the ennobling sentiments Mr. Schlesinger has expressed on behalf of an open, just and democratic society in such classics as ''The Vital Center'' and ''The Disuniting of America.'' But there also seems to be a paradoxical side to his vaunted liberalism that is far too ready to countenance extremism in the service of liberal ideals where unpopular social and political movements are concerned. Mr. Schlesinger writes that ''the idea that the presence of a few Stalinists and fellow-travelers in the film industry was a grave threat to the republic rates high in the annals of Congressional asininity.'' One wonders, then, what clear and present dangers to the Republic could possibly have been averted by Mr. Kazan's collaboration with the House Un-American Activities Committee and its reckless ruination of talented lives.\n",

      "SHINN-Richard R. The directors, officers and employees of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company express sadness at the death of our former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Richard R. Shinn. In true Horatio Alger fashion, he rose from the mail desk in 1939 to head the company. He spent a distinguished forty-nine year career at MetLife, where his dynamic leadership and personal warmth are legendary. Mr. Shinn was elected president in 1969 and assumed the additional position of chief executive officer in 1973. He became chairman of the board and chief executive officer in 1980. He retired in 1983 and continued service to the company as a director until 1988, and thereafter as a valued advisor. Ever a modest man, he attributed his success to good luck and timing. Mr. Shinn guided the company through a decade of tremendous change. Under his direction, MetLife entered multi-line marketing, established regional offices around the country and formed new subsidiaries. Mr. Shinn was known for his energy and common touch. Widely respected for his business acumen, his guidance was sought by corporations, business and charitable organizations. A member of many boards and commissions, he gave generously of his time and talent. His commitment to New York City in good times and bad was unwavering. He earned the respect of business and civic leaders for his wisdom and his gift as a problem solver. His untiring devotion to civic and community activities left us in awe of his drive and ability. The MetLife family extends its sympathy to his wife, Marion, two daughters, Kathleen Clark and Patricia Grossthanner, and his son, John, a MetLife vice president, and his grandchildren and greatchildren. We will miss our friend and colleague, Dick Shinn. We are richer for the privilege of having known him. SHINN-Richard. It is with heartfelt sadness that the Board, Staff, and friends of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. mourn the passing of Richard Shinn. A dear friend and tireless leader, Mr. Shinn served us as an esteemed member and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, as Director Emeritus, and Co-Chair of the Directors Emeriti Council. He was also the Chairman and CEO of MetLife and the Executive ViceChairman of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Shinn generously gave of himself through his service on numerous Lincoln Center committees, including the Committee for the Future, the Steering Committee for the 25th Anniversary Celebration, and the New Building Committee. Mr. Shinn's warmth, faith, energy, and fierce dedication to this institution have been a source of inspiration for us all. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Marion, his daughters, Kathleen Clark and Patricia Grossthanner, his son, John, and his seven grandchildren.

He was instrumental in building the hospital's endowment and ensuring fiscal stability. In 1987 he was named a Trustee Emeritus and continued to demonstrate a keen understanding of Saint Vincent's mission and an abiding commitment to excellence in healthcare. That same year he was awarded the United Hospital Fund's Distinguished Community Service Award for bringing his expertise to the challenges facing Saint Vincents. We extend our deepest condolences to his entire family. SHINN-Richard R. The Barnard College community mourns the loss of Richard R. Shinn, valued friend and adviser, who served as a Barnard trustee from 1985 through 1994, including five years as vice chair.

      "If it sometimes appears as if all good plays book passage to New York on British Airways, then take heart from the all-American flight plan of ''Snakebit,'' David Marshall Grant's finely observed, beautifully acted comedy-drama about the flaming out of friendship and marriage in a deceptively sunny precinct of Los Angeles. It took several years for Mr. Grant, an actor best known for his Tony-nominated role as an anguished Mormon in ''Angels in America,'' to secure a production for this play, his first, but his patience has been rewarded. Under the intuitive stewardship of the director Jace Alexander, ''Snakebit'' renders Mr. Grant's brittle characters with such insight and wryness that by the play's end, you may feel that you've been assigned a seat inside their uncomfortable skins.\n",

      "Not long ago, I had another episode of a recurring nightmare: the going-back-to-the-Bronx dream. In reality, my childhood apartment building on Creston Avenue has long since burned to the ground. In my dreams, though, I must get back to it, no matter how dangerous the journey. I must walk along dark streets where batterers and murderers loiter in every doorway. I must travel on subways that invariably run in the wrong direction. And when I finally arrive, the apartment is deserted, with no lock, no lights, no furniture, no family to protect me. I'm all alone in the Bronx, and I'm terrified right out of my id. At which point, I bolt awake -- and the real nightmare begins. You're up! my conscious mind brays. Good, good you've got a lot of work to do. Forget about the Bronx and your girlish, nameless fears. You can't lie around worrying about phantoms. You need some meat behind your emotions. And so my mind offers for my inspection that fleshiest source of anxiety: work. I worry about the assignments still to be reported, the many stories that I've started but never finished, the parts of my latest book that I must have written under the influence of a J. Peterman catalogue. I review with the crack of a dominatrix's whip every craven act of procrastination that I've engaged in for the past year, for the past lifetime. I revisit some recent writing failures -- clumsy sentences, idiotic metaphors -- and recall verbatim snippy but searingly accurate criticisms from readers.\n",

Slightly built, with thinning hair and a melancholic mien, he chews nervously on a succession of cigarettes, mumbling when he is not sighing or silent. He describes himself as a manic-depressive who becomes excited only when he is writing. His fiction, which he concedes is fairly autobiographical, reflects a bleak and loveless world. Yet last fall, with the publication by Editions Flammarion of his second novel, ''Les Particules Elementaires'' (''Elementary Particles''), the 40-year-old Parisian suddenly found himself at the center of ''l'affaire Houellebecq.'' The book was an instant best seller, with sales exceeding 260,000 to date. But what turned this success into an ''affaire,'' or scandal, was the passion and venom with which the book's admirers and critics argued its merits.\n",

      "In 1969, when the Japanese composer Maki Ishii, then 32, participated in an academic exchange program in Berlin, his German friends kiddingly called him the ''Pendulum Man.'' This was because of his frequent migrations, both geographical and musical, between the East and the West. An attempt to reconcile the two strikingly different traditions has defined the music of Mr. Ishii, who at 62 is now one of Japan's leading composers. A program of his works was performed on Saturday night at Merkin Concert Hall by an impressive roster of American and Japanese musicians, the first of two concerts over the weekend sponsored by Music From Japan. Mr. Ishii's cultural crisscrossing was fairly typical of Japanese composers from his generation. During his student days, Japan was saturated with Western music. Barely out of his teen-age years, Mr. Ishii went to Berlin, where he learned the technique of 12-tone composition, which he further honed in classes at Darmstadt, the mission control center for avant-garde Western music in the early 1960's. Only after this, when he returned to Japan, did Mr. Ishii encounter the traditional music of his own country, first at a Buddhist temple in Nara, a life-altering experience.\n",

The concert that Orpheus gave at Carnegie Hall on Saturday night managed to begin and end in the 18th century and in B flat, the works being a Boccherini symphony and Mozart's last piano concerto. But it was a strange route that took the program through a new composition by Peter Lieberson, his Horn Concerto, and Martinu's little-known Serenade. Perhaps the criterion of choice was simply that each was a piece the musicians wanted to present, as one could easily believe, given the liveliness with which they did so. Mr. Lieberson's work in particular could hardly have had a more fluent and generous first performance, and it justified the care. Written at the behest of William Purvis, who was the soloist, it offered him an essentially singing (sometimes dancing) role. He responded with silky tone, nothing brazen about it, and smooth, beautiful phrasing. His performance was a joy. Meanwhile his colleagues in the orchestra were relishing Mr. Lieberson's fine feeling for orchestral sonorities, his almost Stravinskian way of making an unusual chord sound absolutely right because of how instruments are selected and placed.\n",

      "New Jersey's Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, did the right thing in dismissing Col. Carl Williams as superintendent of the state police because of comments he made in an interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark. Colonel Williams had asserted that certain crimes were associated with certain races, and he specifically linked minorities with drug trafficking. His remarks betrayed pernicious racial stereotyping that cannot be allowed to guide a police force that must deal fairly with all members of a diverse society. Beyond that, the comments provided new insight into the possibility that racial profiling, or the tendency to stop drivers of certain races and skin colors as potential lawbreakers, may be deeply rooted in the police agency. Although Colonel Williams insisted in the Star-Ledger interview that racial profiling would not be condoned, his comments associating crimes with particular racial groups sent the opposite message. Coming from a 35-year veteran who rose through the ranks to lead the 2,700-member force, the remarks suggested that such attitudes may be endemic. In appointing a successor to Colonel Williams, Mrs. Whitman needs to find one who will make a personal commitment to root out all traces of racial stereotyping in the state police and eliminate all individuals in command positions who harbor such attitudes.\n",

Aggravating matters is that doctor-patient communications regarding end-of-life planning tend to be underrepresented in medical school and residency curriculums and poorly modeled by physician educators.\n",

      "FYBISH-Peggy Romano. On January 26, 1999, at her Manhattan home. Dearly loved wife and companion since 1971 of Stephen Fybish. Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.\n",

      "The game was still far from over as Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw sent her team onto the floor midway through the second half. But in the middle of shouting out instructions, she looked as if she was about to cry when she spotted Niele Ivey making her way to the bench, struggling on crutches. The Fighting Irish's junior guard had gone down with a sprained left knee in the second half, and McGraw knew at that point that it meant trouble. Without Ivey, Notre Dame may have trouble with what lies ahead. But with Ivey's pre-injury contributions tonight, the Fighting Irish defeated Rutgers, 68-61, in the semifinals of the Big East tournament at Rutgers's Louis Brown Athletic Center. Notre Dame (25-3) will be without Ivey (16 points, 5 steals), who will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test on Tuesday morning, in Tuesday's Big East tournament final against Connecticut. ''Just the way she was screaming, I kept thinking, 'This is so unfair,' '' McGraw said of Ivey. ''She's had such a great year. She doesn't deserve this. I feel like we won the battle, but lost the war.'' Notre Dame, the No. 3-seeded team and the No. 8-ranked team in the nation, will face the top-seeded Huskies, 77-42 winners over Georgetown tonight, in the final. The Fighting Irish dropped a 25-point decision in their only meeting with the Huskies this season. UConn is 9-0 against Notre Dame. But the Irish proved tonight that history can mean little. Rutgers met Notre Dame once during the regular season, handing the Fighting Irish a 77-57 defeat. ''It was all mental,'' McGraw said. ''We came out and played hard. We were the aggressors, and they fell back on their heels this time.'' Notre Dame beat Rutgers, the No. 2-ranked defensive team in the nation, at its own game, confounding the Scarlet Knights (26-5) with a triangle-and-two defense that keyed on Shawnetta Scott and Tomora Young. Trailing by double figures throughout most of the second half, the Scarlet Knights -- seeded second and ranked seventh in the nation -- were forced to work the clock on each possession to find a shot. Scott, Rutgers's leading scorer, had 11 points in the first half, but attempted only one shot in the first 17 minutes of the second half. ''We've had our ups and downs,'' said Rutgers's point guard Tasha Pointer, who was just 1 of 10 tonight. ''It just speaks to our immaturity.'' Rutgers fell behind early, facing a 10-2 deficit. Sheila McMillen, Notre Dame's all-time leading 3-point shooter, connected three times from beyond the arc before the game was two minutes old. The Scarlet Knights answered back, including a layup, two 3-pointers from Stewart and a 3-pointer from Young to give Rutgers a 13-10 lead. The teams stayed close throughout much of the half until, with Notre Dame holding a 27-26 lead with 5 minutes 21 seconds remaining, the Fighting Irish rattled off 16 straight points. To the end, Rutgers seemed shocked that a showdown with Connecticut for them was gone, along with a chance to play the tournament final on their own floor. But Notre Dame, which left the floor here to the taunts of, ''Over-rated,'' after the last meeting, had a different ending in mind. ''They were fired up. You saw how they came out,'' Stewart said. ''We weren't ready for them. We probably underestimated them. We didn't have it in our heads that when we beat them before, that was then. I didn't think I'd be in this situation.''\n",

A longtime trustee of The Hunter College Foundation, she supported her alma mater throughout her long and productive life and served as a role model to generations of Hunter students-especially women-who aspired to a career in science. She was instrumental in the development of a host of drugs to combat some of the most virulent diseases known, and she was active in the professional community: she was president of the American Association for Cancer Research, a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, among others. Though officially retired for a number of years, she continued to teach and conduct research. She received more than 25 honorary doctorates, including one from Hunter College, which will always remember her for both her scientific accomplishments and her generosity to her College. Allan H. Kurtzman, Chair Floria V. Lasky, Co-Chair The Hunter College Foundation ELION-Gertrude B. The entire Hunter College community is deeply saddened by the loss of Gertrude Elion, a 1937 graduate of Hunter who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988.

A member of the Hunter College Hall of Fame, she was awarded the President's Medal in 1970. When she received an honorary doctorate from Hunter in 1989, the Burroughs Wellcome Company, the pharmaceutical company where she had worked since 1944, established a scholarship endowment fund in her honor. The fund assists Hunter women pursuing careers in science. Dr. Elion will be remembered for her generosity and warmth in working with students as well as for her many contributions to mankind.

It was a full docket for a debut. Although Collins did not revisit a troubled past with relish, in his responses he did more than backpedal and, in the end, it appeared he survived a pressuring rush his first time out.\n",

      "CARLSON-Curtis L. Minnesota entrepreneur. Founder of Carlson Companies. Mr. Carlson died Friday, February 19, after suffering a stroke on February 10. He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year Award from the City of Minneapolis; and numerous awards from the hospitality, travel and marketing industries. He was active in the Masons (33 degree) and Shriners, and Sigma Phi Epsilon national fraternity, from which he received the Order of the Golden Heart. Survivors include his beloved wife of sixty years, Arleen; daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson and husband Dr. Glen Nelson, and daughter Barbara Carlson Gage and husband Edwin ''Skip'' Gage; grandchildren Diana Nelson and husband Marius Muresanu, Curtis Nelson and wife Margie, Wendy Nelson, Daisy Mitchell, Geoffrey Gage and wife Kelly, Scott Gage and wife Gina, Christine Gage, and Richard Gage and wife Britt; six great-grandchildren; brother Warren and wife Jane; sisters-in-law Elaine Carlson and Hazel Carlson; and numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson was preceded in death by brothers Ken and Dean; a sister, Aileen Miller; and granddaughter, Juliet Nelson. Mr. Carlson will be remembered not only for the professional successes he achieved, but also for his love of family and community, and the integrity he demonstrated in everything he did. He lived a full, wonderful life and was an inspiration to his family, friends and colleagues. His sense of humor, guidance and wisdom will be missed. His immediate family, his extended family, and his corporate family around the world have pledged to follow his advice: ''Do not what I did, but seek what I sought.'' The funeral will be Tuesday, February 23, at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church, 511 Groveland, Minneapolis. Visitation is Monday, February 22, at the church. Contributions in his memory may be made to the University of Minnesota, Curtis L. Carlson School of Management and/or Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church. For information, contact Washburn-McReavy Edina Chapel, 612-920-3996.\n"

He was a preeminent specialist in the art of the Northwest Coast Indian shaman, and a senior consultant in American Indian Art and Tribal Art at Christie's in New York. Wardwell, who was educated at Groton, Yale, and New York University, decided against joining the law firm of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, founded by his grandfather and in which his father was a partner, choosing instead to make a career of his passion for fine art. After receiving his Master's in Art History, Wardwell served as head of the Primitive Art Dept at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1960-1973, and was director of the Asia Society Gallery, New York, from 1974-1984. From 1986 to 1990 Wardwell was director of the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in New York. He also taught university courses at various times and, among his many consulting activities was curatorial consultant for African and Oceanic Art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Wardwell was the author of several books and catalogues within his fields, including the recently published study of Northwest Coast shamanic Indian art, ''Tangible Visions''. Wardwell was also passionate about music and dancing, went frequently to the Rainbow Room, and could be seen dancing on his roller skates almost every weekend in Central Park. Allen leaves his wife Sally, a daughter Lelia, his sons William and Alexander, his granddaughter Sarah, two sisters Lelia Seidner and Helen DuBois, and his aunt Clarissa Pell. He was the father-in-law of Deborah Wardwell, Henriette Wardwell, and Edmund Mander. He is also survived by several cousins, nieces and nephews and many, many friends.

Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.\n",

Opulence is an awkward quality to exalt. As applied to music, it suggests at once richness and stagnancy, both coming from the use of complex tonal chords to create an extended sweet dissonance that will never be resolved but must be savored and enjoyed for itself.\n",

      "Since so many Republicans have proclaimed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas as their choice for President, it came as no surprise yesterday when Mr. Bush announced that he would form an exploratory committee. But moving from someone widely mentioned to someone actively running for the job is a huge leap in American politics, especially with a party in such disarray. A clear sign of the troubles Mr. Bush would be stepping into also came yesterday, as Patrick Buchanan announced his candidacy. Mr. Buchanan's full-throated opposition to free trade and immigration is certain to be challenged by Mr. Bush if he runs. The incipient conflict highlights the challenge awaiting the Texan. He is a political figure who is both famous and unknown. To lead a party that is fractured and hungry for victory, he has to move quickly to define himself before others do the job for him. At this stage, the Republican contest consists mostly of second-tier candidates scrambling for attention while both Mr. Bush and Elizabeth Dole float above in the polls. Their popularity is hardly surprising. There has, after all, been someone named Bush or Dole on the Republican ticket of every Presidential election since 1976. But Republicans are divided today as they have not been since the era before Ronald Reagan.\n",

      "David Johansen's career has traveled back through time: from the 1970's protopunk of the New York Dolls to the straightforward rock of his solo albums, and then, as Buster Poindexter, in rediscoveries of old rhythm-and-blues and party songs. (Lately, Buster Poindexter has led a Latin-tinged band, Buster's Spanish Rocketship.) Under his own name at the Bottom Line on Thursday night, Mr. Johansen looked back another few decades, strumming an acoustic guitar and singing blues and hillbilly songs that date back as far as the 1920's. His band was called the Harry Smiths, after the record collector who put together the Anthology of American Folk Music, a trove of songs recorded commercially from 1926 to 1934 and released as a collection in 1952; the anthology was rereleased on CD's in 1997. Smith favored songs that matter-of-factly summed up hard lives and grim events, from heartbreak to murder to premonitions of death. Mr. Johansen's 30-song set drew a few songs from the anthology and others with a similar stoic clarity: lesser-known songs by Muddy Waters, Mississippi John Hurt and Bo Diddley along with selections from the more obscure likes of Daddy Hotcakes, Dock Boggs, Sloppy Henry, Louise Johnson and Jim Jackson.\n",

A tweedy, almost courtly man with a gray buzz cut escorted a visitor to a small, chilly room in a trailer in a driveway of a gated compound on the Avenue de Breteuil, just a few blocks from Napoleon's tomb. His office was being renovated, he said, but it was hard not to feel as though he wanted to keep it off limits to prying eyes. Certainly he was as adamant as any spy master about protecting the identities of his inspectors, whose reports are published in what is essentially code. Even the number in his employ was a secret.\n",

Limpid sententiousness is often more poisonous than ordinary turgidity. Nice turns of phrase paraded self-consciously -- look at me, writing like Henry James! -- can make one pine for a few ugly, flailing but genuinely exploratory neologisms. Readers wishing to compile a ''sottisier'' of academic loftiness, House-manager moralisms and banalities trotted out as difficult truths should start by browsing the works of Ms. Butler's critics.

      "CARLSON-Curtis L. Minnesota entrepreneur. Founder of Carlson Companies. Mr. Carlson died Friday, February 19, after suffering a stroke on February 10. He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year Award from the City of Minneapolis; and numerous awards from the hospitality, travel and marketing industries. He was active in the Masons (33 degree) and Shriners, and Sigma Phi Epsilon national fraternity, from which he received the Order of the Golden Heart. Survivors include his beloved wife of sixty years, Arleen; daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson and husband Dr. Glen Nelson, and daughter Barbara Carlson Gage and husband Edwin ''Skip'' Gage; grandchildren Diana Nelson and husband Marius Muresanu, Curtis Nelson and wife Margie, Wendy Nelson, Daisy Mitchell, Geoffrey Gage and wife Kelly, Scott Gage and wife Gina, Christine Gage, and Richard Gage and wife Britt; six great-grandchildren; brother Warren and wife Jane; sisters-in-law Elaine Carlson and Hazel Carlson; and numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson was preceded in death by brothers Ken and Dean; a sister, Aileen Miller; and granddaughter, Juliet Nelson. Mr. Carlson will be remembered not only for the professional successes he achieved, but also for his love of family and community, and the integrity he demonstrated in everything he did. He lived a full, wonderful life and was an inspiration to his family, friends and colleagues. His sense of humor, guidance and wisdom will be missed. His immediate family, his extended family, and his corporate family around the world have pledged to follow his advice: ''Do not what I did, but seek what I sought.'' The funeral will be Tuesday, February 23, at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church, 511 Groveland, Minneapolis. Visitation is Monday, February 22, at the church. Contributions in his memory may be made to the University of Minnesota, Curtis L. Carlson School of Management and/or Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church.

Wright is a strong, determined, complex young woman who simply will not be denied her place in the Yoruban pantheon.\n",

Mr. Hadush, 27, was not the only one among the tens of thousands of Ethiopians on the streets here today who drew parallels between that victory and the nation's more recent one: Last weekend Ethiopia expelled the Eritrean Army from the Badme region, which they have been fighting over, with words and bullets, for nearly a year.\n",

The change has become clear in recent days as Washington escalated its air strikes against Iraq. The bombing raids appear designed to punish the Iraqi military in hopes that disgruntled officers will lead a rebellion against Mr. Hussein rather than suffer further losses of men and equipment. If this is the new American strategy, President Clinton or Defense Secretary William Cohen should let the American people and Congress know. The air raids are no secret in Iraq, and the potential threat to Mr. Hussein is no doubt well understood in Baghdad. Many Americans might support an effort to unseat Mr. Hussein. But the application of American force overseas should never be a matter of mystery and speculation at home or exempt from Congressional consultation. One of these days an American or British pilot may be captured or killed, and the reasons for placing him in danger ought to be explained before that day arrives.\n",

There have been demonstrations nearly every day outside State Supreme Court in the Bronx, a block from where the grand jury is impaneled in Criminal Court. And lawyers for three of the four police officers involved in the killing of Mr. Diallo, 22, filed the motion seeking to delay the proceedings and change the venue last week, asserting that the ''inflammatory atmosphere'' outside the courthouse had unduly influenced the grand jurors.\n",

      "Put off by the prospect of any more radio blather about Monica Lewinsky or Latrell Sprewell, I decided before setting out on a recent drive to rummage through the glove compartment for any books on tape I might have stored for future listening. There I found a recording of a BBC radio production of ''King Lear'' with Alec Guinness as Lear that had arrived with a Modern Library edition of Shakespeare's tragedies. Having always been intrigued by ''Lear'' as supposedly Shakespeare's most difficult play to stage and having once promised myself to understand its text completely, I stuck the first of its two cassettes into the tape deck and started off on my trip. Everyone knows the basic story of how Lear decides to divide up his kingdom among his three daughters so that he can ''shake all cares and business from our age . . . while we unburthen'd crawl toward death.'' When Cordelia, his youngest, refuses to compete with her sisters in declaring her love for her father, he disinherits her and gives everything to Goneril and Regan, only to have them turn against him and thereby drive him mad. I had read the play in school at least twice and seen it in production several times, albeit several decades ago.\n"

      "The performance of ''Esplanade'' that opens the Academy Award-nominated documentary ''Dancemaker,'' about the Paul Taylor Dance Company and its celebrated choreographer, is filmed from the wings of the stage. There the dancers can be seen preparing to spring into action, and they can be heard breathing heavily afterward, moaning in relief. That signals the mostly blisters-and-all approach of this vivid group portrait, which extends beyond Mr. Taylor's creative processes to offer an overview of lives utterly devoted to dance. Opening today at the Film Forum, it's a must for anyone who reveres modern dance with even an iota of the passion seen onscreen. The hard-working performers seen here are united by the physical kinship of shared experience, and by their consensus that working with Mr. Taylor amounts to a near-religious experience. And as depicted here, Mr. Taylor is not one to disagree with that assessment. Soft-voiced yet coyly, discreetly imperious, he is seen exerting absolute control over dancers who are thrilled to be part of his world. ''Sometimes I think if I asked them to jump out the window they actually would,'' he muses, and he seems to be halfway enjoying that thought.\n",

The impetus behind the Bucks' offer is to avoid losing Brandon, a two-time All-Star point guard, to free agency at the end of the season. Before making a deal, the Nets would most likely want assurances from Brandon that he would re-sign with them instead of testing the free-agent market.

      "Pomerium's concerts of early choral music typically address both the mind and the heart. In this chamber choir's performances, an analytical listener can focus on the details, innovations and structural niceties of a composer's style, with ample technical support from the program notes by Alexander Blachly, the group's founder and director. But the blend of these 14 singers is such that however analytical one might want to be, it is impossible not to be swept into the sound, or to admire it for its sheer beauty and balance. When the program is devoted fully to the music of Josquin, as the group's Sunday afternoon concert in the Music Before 1800 series at Corpus Christi Church was, both these aspects are served exceptionally well. Josquin, more than most of his contemporaries and immediate successors (with the possible exceptions of Lassus and Palestrina) exerts a palpable presence for listeners with any interest at all in pre-Classical works. His smoothly unfolding and seemingly all-enveloping polyphony seems to touch on the sublime, and strikes 20th-century ears as the zenith of sacred text setting, more spiritual in its way than even Bach.\n",

      "To the Editor: Re ''War on Crack Retreats, Still Taking Prisoners'' (front page, Feb. 28): Harmful drug use tends to be self-limiting. In the 1960's we had a speed epidemic that caused great concern. As word got out on the street that ''speed kills,'' the use of speed decreased. The same thing happened with crack. When people learned of its dangers, its popularity decreased. The drug warriors would like to take the credit for the decrease in crack use, of course, but I doubt if all the arrests and billions of dollars spent waging the drug war had much of anything to do with it. Drugs go in and out of fashion independent of drug control policies.\n",

Red wine poses a different problem, since it often arrives at the table with a slight chill.

But it seems not to have been done in this country until last Sunday, when the American Opera Musical Theater Company offered a production to inaugurate a series of Sunday afternoon opera performances at Town Hall. Not too much need be said about the piece. Apart from the Beethoven tune and one or two others, the music is cliche: Mozart minus the imagination, skill and genius. And the libretto -- one of more than 300 by Giovanni Palomba -- takes stock characters through stock situations toward a stock happy ending in a triple wedding. The gentlefolk marry for money, as gentlefolk will, and have been planning to do all along, while the Notary ends up at the windmill with the title character, having tossed aside a promising legal career in a gesture that surely shows the depth of true love to be found among the lower orders.\n",

Then they may have bathed the meat in wine, honey, herbs and spices intended not only to soften the tough, sinewy meat but also to flavor it, and perhaps to obscure the funky smell that develops from old-fashioned aging. Since the earliest days of recorded history, and maybe even before, humans have steeped meat, fowl and fish in some combination of liquid -- usually oil or acid -- and seasonings. At first, there were practical reasons: tough meat needed to be made tender, it needed to be preserved, and with humans ever attuned to improving their lot, it needed to be flavored. But from ranch to refrigerator, almost everything has changed about meat and the way it is treated. Everything, that is, except marination.\n",

But ABC finds itself in a difficult position with its drama ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' because the first five episodes this season all involved the illness and eventual death of the character played by Jimmy Smits. Stu Bloomberg, the chairman of ABC Entertainment, said yesterday that the network felt it would be awkward to repeat episodes with Mr. Smits, and besides, that repeats of ''N.Y.P.D.

She was instrumental in the development of a host of drugs to combat some of the most virulent diseases known, and she was active in the professional community: she was president of the American Association for Cancer Research, a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, among others. Though officially retired for a number of years, she continued to teach and conduct research. She received more than 25 honorary doctorates, including one from Hunter College, which will always remember her for both her scientific accomplishments and her generosity to her College. Allan H. Kurtzman, Chair Floria V. Lasky, Co-Chair The Hunter College Foundation ELION-Gertrude B. The entire Hunter College community is deeply saddened by the loss of Gertrude Elion, a 1937 graduate of Hunter who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988. During a long and distinguished career as a pioneering research scientist, she helped develop drugs to combat leukemia, septic shock, malaria, organ transplantation rejection, and AIDS. A member of the Hunter College Hall of Fame, she was awarded the President's Medal in 1970. When she received an honorary doctorate from Hunter in 1989, the Burroughs Wellcome Company, the pharmaceutical company where she had worked since 1944, established a scholarship endowment fund in her honor. The fund assists Hunter women pursuing careers in science. Dr. Elion will be remembered for her generosity and warmth in working with students as well as for her many contributions to mankind.

      "That Paul Taylor is one of our greatest, and most varied, choreographers was beautifully demonstrated on Tuesday night when the Paul Taylor Dance Company opened an engagement running through March 14 at City Center. The program, a benefit for the company, was a special one, for in addition to the New York premiere of ''Oh, You Kid!'' it offered this season's only performances of two major, stylistically dissimilar works, ''Airs'' and ''Sunset.'' ''Airs'' is sheer joy -- quiet joy. Its seven dancers look blissfully happy as they rejoice to a potpourri of music by Handel (heard, as with all the evening's scores, on tape). But no one grows boisterous, and the choreography preserves a wonderful sense of stillness. Curving patterns of movement sometimes come to a halt, as if the performers wished to pause in the middle of a phrase to savor the beauty of their bodily shapes in space. Thus Francie Huber made the hesitations in her solo as lovely as its steps.\n",

Saving the largest privately owned grove of ancient redwood trees in the world for future generations is a tribute to the public officials and tireless private citizens who made it happen. The deal is also a vindication of the much-maligned Endangered Species Act, without which the trees would surely have been doomed. But there is much more to this deal than the redwoods, and despite all the celebratory noises in Washington and Sacramento, it is far too early to claim victory. Under a so-called habitat conservation plan, the company has also agreed to restrictions on how and where it will harvest timber on the 200,000 acres it owns outside the redwood groves. The purpose of these rules is to save the habitat and improve the prospects of several endangered species, notably California's coho salmon and a seabird called the marbled murrelet.\n",

Suddenly, in her liaison with an amiable carnival worker in devil's horns, played by Larry Pine, deeper feelings stir. Can this, at long last, be love? Embroidered by a parade of Lee's colorful family members, the play retains a cozy, antique feel, entirely suitable for a story set in the California of the late 1950's. But for this variety of retro lollygagging to work, a playwright should have some special affinity for screwball antics or vibrant repartee. Ms. Mayer, unfortunately, exhibits neither.

      "von LIEBIG-William J., an honored inventor, entrepreneur and philanthropist died on Sunday, February 21, 1999 at Mayo Hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona. Born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, William von Liebig earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Juniata College, a Masters of Science degree from the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Sciences and a Masters of Business Administration from New York University. During World War II, he served as Alternate Lead Pilot with the 8th Air Force in Europe. The operations officer to whom he reported was Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Stewart with the famous 389th Bomb Group. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters and a Presidential Citation for his military service. After the war, he embarked on a career in textile sales and manufacturing which coupled with his interest in medicine, led to the development of Meadox Medicals, Inc. in 1961. Meadox Medicals manufactured and distributed vascular grafts and other devices designed to treat cardiovascular disease. Mr. von Liebig holds 33 patents for vascular prostheses and his inventions have made significant contributions to the field of vascular surgery, particularly to the technological advancement of textile vascular grafts used in the reconstruction and replacement of human arteries. Over the years, he received a host of achievement awards including the Gold Hektoen Award from the American Medical Association, the 1995 Independent Inventor of the Year Award from the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the Carothers Medal from the Textile Institute in England. In 1991, Mr. von Liebig received the national Alumni Achievement Award from Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. In 1975 he established The von Liebig Foundation which generously supports medical research, primarily for the treatment of vascular and cardiovascular diseases. In 1981, the Foundation established an award for Residents and Fellows to be granted annually to encourage and recognize research among young trainees interested in a career in vascular surgery. The von Liebig Foundation and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute jointly funded a grant to the Lifeline Foundation in 1998 to sponsor the Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Awards for the benefit of vascular surgeon scientists in the early stages of their research careers. The purpose of the award is to support the development of clinician research scientists. In 1990, William von Liebig and his wife, Suzanne, relocated to Naples, Florida. They have continued their philanthropic efforts expanding their mission to affect an even broader population. Together they have supported the arts and education with substantial gifts to Juniata College and, in their community, the Naples Philharmonic, the von Liebig Art Center and the Naples Depot. Surviving family include his loving wife, Suzanne, of Naples, Florida, his sister, Edith Liebig of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, his daughter and son-in-law, Barbara and Bill Thomashower of New York City, and his grandchildren, David and Charley. Memorial services will be held in New York City on March 23, 1999 at the Campbell Funeral Chapel at 4:00pm and in Naples, Florida on March 31, 1999 at the Daniels Pavilion of The Naples Philharmonic at 4:00pm. In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that contributions be made to the von Liebig Art Center Endowment Fund. Mailing address: The von Liebig Art Center, 585 Park Street, Naples, FL 34102.\n",

If the plant is growing somewhere near the northern edge of its range, in southern New Jersey, for instance, it may simply be getting blasted each year by frost. Many old-fashioned hardy camellias (C. japonica) are vulnerable this way. And if the plant is growing in a pot and being moved indoors for the winter, the bud drop could be due to dry air.

With 220 drawings and collages from the formative years that Kelly spent in France, and a focus on the simplicity of line, form and color that were hallmarks of his career, this show captures the period when the artist worked out his personal abstract esthetic. Many of the works in the show, which closes on May 16 before traveling to Atlanta, Chicago, Switzerland and Germany, have never been exhibited. Playtime For the Alexander Quartet, the long day's journey into night that begins on Sunday at Merkin Concert Hall consists of eight Beethoven quartets, played morning (two at 11:25), afternoon (three at 3) and evening (three at 7:25). But that's only half the story. The ensemble, from San Francisco, will play the other nine Beethoven quartets the following Sunday, three at a time in performances on the same daylong schedule. The musicians, who are celebrating the completion of a recording of the Beethoven quartets on BMG's Arte Nova label, are artists in residence at Baruch College.\n"

      "The power of democracy is altering Iran. Unofficial results from municipal elections show that Iranians overwhelmingly supported moderate politicians associated with President Mohammad Khatami. The voting mirrored the presidential election that swept Mr. Khatami to power two years ago. Though conservative clerics remain the paramount rulers of Iran, Iranians are clearly impatient to lift religious repression and transform their country. Iran's Constitution, adopted after Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution, provides for local elections, but none were held for two decades. Mr. Khatami called last Friday's vote hoping to create a more decentralized civil society that could support his agenda of political and social change. His gamble apparently paid off. The winners included liberal clerics like Abdollah Nouri, a Khatami ally who was forced out of the national Cabinet last year by clerical conservatives and who has now been elected to the Teheran city council. The high turnout that carried many moderate candidates to victory may now embolden Mr. Khatami to take further conciliatory steps toward America.\n",

      "LAURIE CRIBBS bought her new Lexus LS 400 for its luxurious appointments, but what really impressed her were its trendsetting super-bright headlights. ''I noticed them right away, because I didn't like to drive at night before,'' Ms. Cribbs said recently from the offices of Marriott International in Potomac, Md., where she works as a senior financial manager. ''In my car now, it's like night and day. The headlights light up everything so much, it's very noticeable. With the brights on, it's like daylight.'' The technology that tamed the night for Ms. Cribbs is called High Intensity Discharge, or HID, and it is an increasingly hard-to-miss sight on the nation's roads. The new headlights throw a broad field of intensely clear light -- so white-hot that it appears to burn blue at the edges. The benefits are equally clear. Compared to standard yellow-white headlights, they cut through the night with light that more closely approximates the spectrum of daylight. Darkness is banished as the car drives forward into its own private pocket of renewable daylight.\n",

      "WHEN Antonio Levane immigrated to America from Naples early in this century, he was 10 years old. To help out his family, he played a mandolin for pennies on the streets of Brooklyn. He went on to play the double bass in renowned orchestras, such as at the Metropolitan Opera House, and for such classical luminaries as Caruso and Toscanini. Of course, Antonio Levane wanted his six children to play musical instruments. But some of his children, particularly the one that the nation would come to know as Fuzzy, had other notions. ''Pop first tried to teach me the cello,'' Levane said recently, ''and I'd practice for an hour or so -- I did learn some notes -- and then duck out to play ball. But Pop was determined. He thought I'd respond to a more modern instrument and tried to teach me the saxophone. Same result. All the time my sisters were playing instruments, and Lucille even became a concert pianist.''\n",

      "WARDWELL-Allen, 64. Died March 1 of a heart attack while vacationing in Colorado. He was a preeminent specialist in the art of the Northwest Coast Indian shaman, and a senior consultant in American Indian Art and Tribal Art at Christie's in New York. Educated at Groton, Yale, and New York University, Wardwell opted not to pursue a career in law-his grandfather founded the law firm of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, in which his father was a partnerchoosing instead to find work through his passion for fine art. After receiving his Master's in Art History, Wardwell served as head of the Primitive Art Dept at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1960-1973, and was director of the Asia Society Gallery, New York, from 1974-1984. From 1986 to 1990 Wardwell was director of the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in New York. He also taught university courses at various times and, among his many consulting activities was curatorial consultant for African and Oceanic Art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Wardwell was the author of several books and catalogues within his fields, including the recently published study of Northwest Coast shamanic Indian art, ''Tangible Visions''. Wardwell was also passionate about music and dancing, went frequently to the Rainbow Room, and could be seen dancing on his roller skates almost every weekend in Central Park. Allen leaves his wife Sally, a daughter Lelia, his sons William and Alexander, his granddaughter Sarah, two sisters Lelia Seidner and Helen DuBois, and his aunt Clarissa Pell. He was the father-in-law of Deborah Wardwell, Henriette Wardwell, and Edmund Mander. He is also survived by several cousins, nieces and nephews and many, many friends. For details about a celebration of Allen's life, please call Edmund Mander 212-665-5373. WARDWELL-Allen. The trustees, staff & friends of the Asia Society mourn the loss of Allen Wardwell, former Director of the Asia Society Galleries (1974-1984) and Honorary Friend of Asian Arts. Allen mounted over 30 exhibitions on the arts of Asia and oversaw the installation of the renowned Mrs. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III Collection of Asian Art at our Park Avenue headquarters. In addition to his work with the Asia Society, Allen was of exemplary service to a great number of other institions, sharing his expertise on topics ranging from Northwest Coast Shamanic Indian art to traditional Japanese art. Allen remained a close friend, advisor and supporter of Asia Society activities throughout his accomplished life. Our deep condolences go out to to his loving wife Sally, his children and other family members. Allen will be missed by all of us at the Asia Society and by everyone who knew him. WARDWELL-Allen. The neighbors of Allen Wardwell at 88 express their profound sadness and offer condolences to his wife, Sally, and to their three children and families. His joy of home, family, culturual pursuits, park, dog, study, and travel was a stimulant to all he met. His zest for life and unsurpassable style will be missed. WARDWELL-Allen. The Board of Directors and the staff of the Isamu Noguchi Foundation, Inc. extend their deepest sympathy to Sally Wardwell for the loss of her husband, Allen. We shall miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with Sally and her family. Isaac Shapiro, President\n"

To the band and its label it was unexpected news after four years in which business threatened to overwhelm music.

One-third of that debt was owed to an insurance company that said that a band member, Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes, had to pay damages for setting fire to the house of the football player Andre Rison, who was then her boyfriend.\n",

      "A CONTINUING spat between Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, over modernizing bank regulations threatens to bury legislation that comes before House and Senate committees today. They agree that laws from the 1930's and 1950's that keep banks out of the securities and insurance markets should be scrapped. But they disagree how banks should be structured to handle their new responsibilities. Mr. Rubin, with the support of most economists, looks as if he will get most of what he wants from the House. Mr. Greenspan, drawing powerful support from past and present Fed officials, may win in the Senate. Indeed, the Administration yesterday threatened to veto the proposal by Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate banking committee. The risk is that Congress will be deadlocked, forcing the economy to operate under Depression-era rules for at least a few more years.\n",

      "When Manny Malhotra celebrates his 19th birthday on May 18, he probably will not be playing hockey. Even if the rebuilding Rangers qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs, they almost certainly will be eliminated by then. And the overall statistics for 1998-99 will show Malhotra as a first-round draft choice who did not play much for most of the schedule. He probably will not get any votes for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year. An outsider might conclude that this was a so-so debut for a young man chosen seventh over all in the National Hockey League entry draft. But, in the last week, Malhotra's progress has accelerated and he shows enormous promise. Fans can see why General Manager Neil Smith refused to include Malhotra in a trade for Pavel Bure in January, killing a deal with Vancouver. Playing without the injured Wayne Gretzky against three of the N.H.L.'s better teams in Madison Square Garden, the Rangers took 5 of 6 possible points, the last in a 2-2 tie on Tuesday against Dallas, the best team in the league. And Malhotra was important from the beginning.\n",

The sales slump spurred the auto maker to begin a huge incentive campaign aimed at loyal G.M. owners. The successful promotion kept G.M. sales rolling until workers at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., went on strike, closing nearly all of G.M.'s assembly plants for most of the summer. Since then, the auto maker has struggled to catch up to its pre-strike sales momentum and inventory levels.\n",

The life of Rivera, a Rabelaisian omnivore, was a legend wrapped in scandal surrounded by myth that played against the backdrop of brightly colored buildings, as if he were a figure walking through one of his own heroic canvases. No man is an island, but houses are often worlds unto themselves, especially the three buildings owned by the Mexican painters Rivera and Kahlo, together and separately, and designed by and with the Mexican architect Juan O'Gorman. These buildings, in the southern suburbs of Mexico City, housed the couple: the paired red and blue studios they occupied in San Angel from 1932 until their divorce in 1939; La Casa Azul, or the Blue House, in nearby Coyoacan, where they lived after their remarriage in 1940 until Kahlo's death in 1954, and the Aztec-Tolmec house-studio in Anahuacalli, finished after Rivera's death in 1957.\n",

      "In 1997, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company settled on ''No bull'' as an advertising slogan for its Winston cigarettes, which it said were 100 percent tobacco with no additives. The Federal Trade Commission, however, detected at least a little confusion among consumers and announced yesterday that the company, a unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, would start including disclaimers with its Winston advertising. The disclaimers, an RJR spokeswoman said, will read, ''No additives in our tobacco does not mean a safer cigarette.'' Questions about how consumers interpreted the company's advertising arose after complaints from anti-smoking groups in 1997. The commission conducted its own research and determined that people could be confused by the advertising, said Jodie Bernstein, director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection.\n",

      "You should have fun with the exhibition of Picasso's ceramic work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Picasso certainly seems to have enjoyed carving this particular notch in his cane of art conquests. That he did so during one of the happiest periods of his life may partly account for the unclouded lightness of these charming figures, wittily decorated plates, casseroles, pitchers, masks and glazed-tile paintings. Perhaps the second-class status traditionally accorded ceramics had a relaxing effect, contributing to the air of genius on holiday, veering in and out of focus, that permeates this show. The best pieces are utterly transparent. They reduce Picasso's transforming genius to its most basic, accessible components; present his favorite subjects in a medium that seem to fuse painting, sculpture and drawing into a single, fluid process, and reveal another side of his easy familiarity with different artistic periods and styles. The less successful works parody those styles to the brink of kitsch and confirm the careless bravado that Picasso could almost always summon: even on automatic pilot he produced things that were at least Picassos and sometimes only that. And they reiterate his reflexive obsession with the female form. When is a vessel just a vessel? Almost never.\n",

      "The most appealing exotica produced in backwater Central Asia during the 19th century -- as far from Paris as you could get, fashionwise -- were the gorgeously colored and patterned handmade silks known as ikat. Made by the complex ''resist'' method, which entails repeated binding and dying of the threads before they are woven into fabric, ikat goes back to ancient times and is known to many cultures throughout the world. The Central Asian ikat revival that came and went in the last century involved not only many intricate processes but -- talk about multicultural! -- a rich mix of ethnic types who cooperated in carrying them out: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Iranians and Jews, among others, each a specialist in dying, weaving or another aspect of the trade. Imbued, like their clientele, with the Central Asian passion for textiles, they made ikats for sale as luxury goods and worked them into presentation and ceremonial robes. In Bukhara and Samarkand, along with smaller outposts in this desert-and-steppe segment of the old silk route, your social status was judged by the number and quality of ikats you wore and hung on your walls, and a bride's dowry was nothing without them.\n",

Harrold Carswell. But Harry Blackmun, the retired Justice who died yesterday at the age of 90, evolved during a remarkable 24-year career on the Court from a bland and conservative ''Minnesota twin'' of his boyhood friend Chief Justice Warren Burger to an empathetic champion of civil rights and civil liberties. Justice Blackmun secured his legacy just three years into his tenure by writing the Court's wise decision in Roe v. Wade that established women's constitutional right to abortion. As the Court's membership changed, and amid a steady stream of hate mail, he fought hard to preserve Roe's central holding and to fend off new abortion restrictions.\n",

      "For me, the essence of surfing is the quest for the rare summer wave: the gleam of morning sun on an August swell, the wafting scent of wild roses and cocoa butter, a water temperature of 70 degrees. Never mind that 100 surfers may have had the same idea, at the same beach. Generally, I've kept a wary distance from winter waves and those surfing zealots bundled head to toe in neoprene, poised to leap from a snow-covered beach into 38-degree water. I thought of them as a Polar Bear Club of surfing's pious, too fervid to be credible. In recent years, though, I've noticed that more of my surfer friends in the Northeast have shed their winter inhibitions. This cadre of surfers -- congregating in Long Beach, N.Y., near Wakefield, R.I., Ocean City, N.J., and elsewhere -- has grown. There may be fewer than 100 winter surfers in each of those locales and just several hundred total in the region. But those surfers, I came to see, were catching better, more consistent waves without the accompanying crowds. And because the danger was greater, the dedicated few, like polar explorers, seemed to have a strong bond both to surfing and to other kindred spirits.\n",

Mr. Stephens was born in Brooklyn, New York on September 18, 1922. He graduated from Polytechnic Preparatory School in Brooklyn and Colgate University where he attended summer sessions in order to join the U.S. Army during World War II as a private in 1942. Mr. Stephens served in the 36th infantry division of the 5th Army and eventually rose to first lieutenant in command of a rifle company with the 7th Army. He served in North Africa, Italy, France and Germany and participated in numerous campaigns, including Rapido River, Monte Cassino, the Breakthrough at Anzio, the liberation of Rome, and the invasions of Southern France and the German Rhineland. He received a battlefield commission for heroic action beyond the line of duty, the Bronze Star with a cluster, five battle stars and the combat infantryman's badge, among other decorations. After the War, Mr. Stephens earned his law degree from Syracuse University and practiced in New York City before founding the firm Stephens & Buderwitz in White Plains, New York where he practiced for nearly 40 years. Mr. Stephens ran for mayor of White Plains in 1952 and was continually active in White Plains and Westcheter County affairs. He served as President of the Bar Association of White Plains, President of the YMCA, President of the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in White Plains and on the board of EM Industries and numerous other corporations. He was a member of the Whippoorwill Club in Armonk, New York. Mr. Stephens was instrumental in the planning and design of the Kingsley House residences on Barker Avenue in White Plains, restructured its sponsorship and funding and assured its completion after the initial program encountered difficulties prior to completion. Funeral services will be held at the White Plains Presbyterian Church 39 North Broadway, White Plains on Saturday, March 6, at 10:30 am.

      "Guy Ritchie's brash, ebullient direction of his first feature, ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' makes it very obvious that he honed his style making music videos and commercials. And for once that doesn't hurt. The punchy little flourishes that load this English gangster film with attitude are perfectly welcome, because there's no honest, substantial part of the movie they can hurt. Mr. Ritchie is skillful enough to make a fine feat of macho gamesmanship out of the way four sets of East End crooks keep outsmarting one another. And if that means having them all arm for battle while the ''Zorba the Greek'' theme music heightens the intensity of the moment, well, why not? Touches like that, along with flashy, random shifts of film speed and a true rogues' gallery of striking if one-note characters, do hold interest even if they have no real right to. The commercial aspects also deflect attention from the fact that this story has almost no center at all. The closest it comes to heroes are the four savvy young con men whom the film introduces first. Mr. Ritchie brings on Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemying), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) as if they were the ''Trainspotting'' crew, but the story soon begins to lose them in the shuffle. Thick accents, desaturated brownish color and 20-odd actors with comparably important roles don't do much to alleviate this mild confusion.\n",

Judging by the first of these, to be seen on Sunday night, the bet has paid delightful dividends. It's 1793, and the French are revolting. Things are getting out of hand; those who toppled the King are proving to be tyrants themselves. Heads are rolling. Literally. But there is one ray of hope: a small, mysterious band has been rescuing some innocent prisoners from the clutches of Robespierre's henchmen and spiriting them to safety in England. The band's fearless leader (O.K., you try telling this story without cliches) is known by his nom de guerre, the Scarlet Pimpernel. Who is he?\n",

      "Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's renewed push for a school voucher experiment illustrates what can happen when his national political ambitions conflict with the needs of New York City's public schools. A voucher program could enhance the Mayor's image in national Republican circles, but it might also lose him a fine Schools Chancellor, Rudy Crew. Dr. Crew says he will resign if the Mayor forces a voucher plan that uses public funds for private or parochial schools. As the Chancellor puts it: ''Always in your life you come up to the proverbial hill to die on. This is mine.'' For the Mayor, whose aides protest that Dr. Crew is not really serious about leaving over this issue, it is apparently worth the gamble. For the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren, however, it is not. Mr. Giuliani has been lobbying the city's Board of Education to approve a pilot voucher program over the next three years in one of 32 school districts. The voucher issue has long been the darling of the Republican Party, and the Mayor, now eyeing higher office, has said vouchers could provide much-needed competition for the city's schools. Some voucher systems, like one in Milwaukee that the Mayor particularly admires, have also drawn support from those locked in the worst school districts because they provide hope of a way out for at least a few children from low-income families.\n",

He notes that the Social Security Trust Fund lends its money to the Treasury. But if there were a tax cut instead, the trust fund would have less to lend to the Treasury, and the Treasury would need to borrow more from the public. If the public lends more to the Treasury, it invests less in stocks, bonds and deposits, resulting in less investment and lower economic growth.\n",

Yet there is more to the music. If the ear is thoughtful, deep beauty exists beneath the glitter. Leif Ove Andsnes, the young Norwegian who played a recital at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night, passes the seriousness test quite well. He has the pristine technique, the sound and the control of big gestures needed for all those flying octaves, scales and double notes, but he also finds the dignity and inspired sentiment that fill the B-minor Ballade and ''Apres une Lecture de Dante.''\n",

Ms. Peters, as you probably know, is one of the few great performers under 70 who came of age in the American musical theater, and she still treats a Broadway stage as though it were her first home. When she starts to sing in that oversize little-girl voice, it feels like an invitation to walk straight into her heart. Even the silliest seeming ditties can become affectingly sincere confessions when delivered by Ms. Peters. She is an enduring and essential reminder of the emotional vitality of a genre that in recent years has lost its way.\n",

Previously, the pianist, who was trained at the Moscow Conservatory, had taken first prizes in the Franz Liszt Competition in Weimar and the Shostakovich Competition in Hanover.

They look for the parent's technical facility and expressive individuality in the child, and worry if they don't hear it (such a pity not to have absorbed something from a model close at hand) and if they do (similarities could indicate a lack of originality). They wonder to what degree the parent's connections ease the way for the child, or to what degree the shadow of a famous parent is inhibiting. But there isn't much use to beard-pulling of this sort. One might have a genetic predisposition toward musical expression, and a name that brings immediate recognition, but getting to the stage and making a respectable showing still takes a tremendous amount of training. And many children of the famous who make it that far have proved that they deserve their share of the spotlight regardless of family connections: Peter Serkin, Pamela Frank and Dmitri Sitkovetsky come immediately to mind.\n",

      "MERESMAN-Harry. Died on March 3, 1999 at the age of 88. Beloved husband of the late Helen Chafets Meresman, devoted father of Helaine Meresman Barnett and the late Janis Meresman Goldman, adored grandfather of Craig and Jennifer Barnett, Roger Barnett, Melissa Goldman, Lori and Brett Zbar, great-grandfather of Gabriel Barnett, father-in-law extraodinaire to Victor Barnett and Michael Goldman, loving son, brother, brother-in-law, uncle and loyal, trusted and respected friend. A man whose unquestioned integrity, ethics and morality were his hallmarks and his devotion to his family, committment to his community and his pride in his profession were his passions. The high standards by which he lead his life and his impeccable reputation will remain to all who knew him as his everlasing legacy. Funeral services Friday, March 5, 1999, 1:15pm at The Riverside Chapel, 76th Street & Amsterdam Avenue. MERESMAN-Harry. The Board and staff of the Charles H. Revson Foundation deeply mourn the passing of Harry Meresman, one of the Foundation's founding directors and for many years its Secretary/Treasurer. Harry served at the side of Charles Revson-as his accountant, advisor, confidante and closest of friends-from the 1930's until Mr. Revson's death in 1975. As a director of the Revson Foundation, Harry was unfailingly kind, a man with deep ethical standards and a Jewish heart. It was a privilege to work with him, and the Foundation owes much to his careful stewardship and steady guidance. Our hearts go out to his daughter, Helaine Barnett, a current director of the Foundation, to his son-in-law, Victor Barnett, a former director of the Foundation, and to his grandchildren and extended family. Robert S. Rifkind, Chairman Eli N. Evans, President MERESMAN-Harry. Temple Israel Center of White Plains mourns the passing of its former president, Harry Meresman. His devotion to this community, to Jewish education, to the people of Israel, and to his family and friends, remain an enduring inspiration. We extend condolences to his daughter Helaine Meresman Barnett, his sons-in-law Victor Barnett and Michael Goldman, his devoted grandchildren and his entire family. ''The righteous man will be remembered forever.'' Gordon Tucker, Rabbi Richard Greenfield, President MERESMAN-Harry. Fifth Avenue Synagogue records with profound sorrow the passing of its former member, beloved father of its esteemed member, Mrs. Helaine Barnett, and father-in-law of its Honorary President, Mr. Victor J. Barnett. Heartfelt sympathy is extended to the bereaved family. Dr. Sol Roth, Rabbi, Hermann Merkin, Founding Pres., David Yagoda, Chairman, Dr. William Schwartz, President\n",

Broadway * ''DEATH OF A SALESMAN.'' In the harrowing half-century anniversary revival of Arthur Miller's masterwork, you walk right into the mind of its decimated hero, played with majestic, unnerving transparency by Brian Dennehy. Robert Falls's shadow-shrouded, powerhouse staging never looks down on Mr. Miller's deluded Brooklyn dreamer or looks ennoblingly up to him as a martyr to a success-driven country. Instead, it demands that you experience Willy's suffering without sociological distance, that you surrender to the sense of one man's pain. Yes, there's no avoiding the clunky speechifying and symbolism. But this interpretation is, above all, committed to the work's tragic, conflicted familial love story. Even as it expertly conjures Willy's grimly distorted worldview, the production lets us see clearly his effect on those around him. Led superbly by Elizabeth Franz, who redefines the role of Linda Loman, and Kevin Anderson, as Willy's rudderless elder son, those people express, in highly personalized portraits, the genuine pity and terror given more abstract voice by the choruses of Greek tragedy.

      "Not so long ago, in movieland, couples met cute. In ''Relax . . . It's Only Sex,'' they have sex cute. Two fashionable West Hollywood gay men make love while discussing a future menu (something about salmon and fresh parsley). Another gay man carries on an internal (voice-over) monologue through much of the act about the advisability of taking a particular health risk. The film's token straight couple ravage each other in the kitchen so recklessly that nearby pots and pans rattle and clatter to the floor. This is shortly after the woman, Tara (Jennifer Tilly), tries to prove just how adorably frank she is by hitting the man, Gus (Timothy Paul Perez), on the back and whining, ''But I want your sperm!'' Tara sets the tone for ''Relax . . . It's Only Sex,'' an energetic and often good-looking but completely unseductive film from P. J. Castellaneta. In this comic drama about a group of California friends, Tara gets the lines that are meant to be endearingly naive (''AIDS is the biggest tragedy of the 20th century. Even Madonna thinks so.'') or casually clever (''You know how lesbians are. They're like Catholics or 'Saturday Night Live.' They go on forever, no matter how bad it gets'').\n",

Watching these fresh-faced actors go through the motions of seducing and betraying their classmates at a fancy Manhattan private school is rather like watching child actors playing gangsters in Alan Parker's Prohibition-era movie ''Bugsy Malone.'' You have the queasy sense that the whole thing is just an elaborate stunt, and in this case an exploitative one. ''Cruel Intentions,'' written and directed by Roger Kumble, is the fourth and by far the weakest film adaptation of Laclos's epistolary novel. It is the second, following Roger Vadim's European jet-set version (with Jeanne Moreau and Gerard Philipe as a promiscuous married couple) to update it. Although the Vadim adaptation (in 1960) had its ridiculous moments, it at least had a couple of world-class sex symbols pulling the strings.\n",

He was a great-great-grandson of Elbridge Gerry, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation and the politician for whom the term gerrymander was reportedly named. The word, pronounced with a soft G, unlike the family name, describes the act of designing an oddly shaped electoral district to favor a particular candidate or party.\n",

      "The German soprano Dorothea Roschmann has already won considerable attention at some prestigious European opera houses and festivals. She made an acclaimed debut at the Salzburg Festival in 1995 as Susanna in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' has sung lyric soprano roles by Mozart, Strauss and Stravinsky in Munich and Halle and is currently a member of the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin. So even at a young age she would seem to be a practiced professional. Still, making a North American recital debut, as Ms. Roschmann did on Monday night at the Walter Reade Theater as part of Lincoln Center's Great Performers series, creates a lot of pressure. Though her vocal gifts and musical intelligence were abundantly clear, Ms. Roschmann seemed somewhat nervous on this occasion. Her recital manner seems to be of the discreet arms-still-at-the-side school. But even so, she seemed a little stiff. Her American-born pianist, Gary Gromis, who has lived in Germany since 1978 and is Ms. Roschmann's frequent partner, also seemed on edge. His playing was shapely, musical and sensitive, but occasional finger slips and some awkward passages seemed signs of uneasiness.\n",

But a ''soft partition under a hard fist,'' a ''hard partition'' or an outright military victory are not the only scenarios. If the United States and NATO are not willing to sustain troops on the ground indefinitely, it is more appropriate to admit this constraint. This is especially true since the risks of military escalation and human rights violations emanate from both sides. The United States should persuade the Contact Group to consider noncoercive sanctions to punish or deter the Serbian Government and/or the Kosovo Liberation Army, unless and until the United States is ready to invade militarily and one side seems like the aggressor.

For a long time, many minority communities in the city have felt that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the police do not care enough about building relations of trust or hearing their concerns about incidents of police brutality. Although the commission hearing, scheduled for late May, is not directly linked to the Diallo shooting, it may offer aggrieved citizens a forum at which the Mayor and Police Commissioner Howard Safir can address concerns about over-aggressive police practices that have victimized innocent people.

The judge ruled that although there was evidence that the woman had a ''bonded relationship'' with the twins, the relationship was not equivalent to parenthood.\n",

They wanted, quite simply, revenge against the only team that had beaten them twice this season and surged past them in the national polls in the final week of the regular season. They owed them, Coach Mike Jarvis said. The payoff finally came last night when, in the waning seconds of a game full of brutal defense and extraordinary intensity, point guard Erick Barkley, who had promised that Miami had another thing coming if it thought this third game would be a cakewalk, stripped Johnny Hemsley of the ball as the clock wound down to single digits, securing a 62-59 victory over the ninth-ranked Hurricanes and St. John's first trip to the Big East final since 1986.\n",

Two gangsta rappers who have sold millions of albums -- Jay-Z, who won the 1999 Grammy Award for best rap album, and DMX -- are headlining a tour that is selling out arenas, including the Continental Airlines Arena here on Wednesday night. The tour, which also includes Method Man and Redman, reflects the latest resurgence of East Coast rap. Redman is from Newark, N.J., Jay-Z is from Brooklyn, DMX is from Yonkers, and Method Man is from Staten Island. They have meshed the fast-talking East Coast approach with the true-crime narratives that were polished by the Death Row Records roster in California.

That worthy conductor appeared at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening to lead the Orchestra of St. Luke's in the culminating concert of its seasonlong Haydn Festival. Mr. Norrington's brisk, lithe style and wry, witty personality fitted Haydn like a glove, and the opening work, Symphony No. 103 (''Drum Roll''), was a riveting pleasure from its opening bars. Mr. Norrington cued Maya Gunji to shatter the silence with the timpani roll that gives the work its name, then simply waited, with the knowing patience of a master actor, for that outburst to spend itself before bringing in the low strings; their mysterious murky unison was made all the more bizarre for being presented, in Norringtonian fashion, without vibrato.\n",

Beloved husband of the late Helen Chafets Meresman, devoted father of Helaine Meresman Barnett and the late Janis Meresman Goldman, adored grandfather of Craig and Jennifer Barnett, Roger Barnett, Melissa Goldman, Lori and Brett Zbar, great-grandfather of Gabriel Barnett, father-in-law extraordinaire to Victor Barnett and Michael Goldman, loving son, brother, brother-in-law, uncle and loyal, trusted and respected friend. A man whose unquestioned integrity, ethics and morality were his hallmarks and his devotion to his family, commitment to his community and his pride in his profession were his passions. The high standards by which he lead his life and his impeccable reputation will remain to all who knew him as his everlasting legacy. MERESMAN-Harry. The Board and staff of the Charles H. Revson Foundation deeply mourn the passing of Harry Meresman, one of the Foundation's founding directors and for many years its Secretary/Treasurer. Harry served at the side of Charles Revson-as his accountant, advisor, confidante and closest of friends-from the 1930's until Mr. Revson's death in 1975. As a director of the Revson Foundation, Harry was unfailingly kind, a man with deep ethical standards and a Jewish heart. It was a privilege to work with him, and the Foundation owes much to his careful stewardship and steady guidance. Our hearts go out to his daughter, Helaine Barnett, a current director of the Foundation, to his son-in-law, Victor Barnett, a former director of the Foundation, and to his grandchildren and extended family. Robert S. Rifkind, Chairman Eli N. Evans, President MERESMAN-Harry. With warm sympathy we mourn the loss of the beloved father of our sister-inlaw and aunt, Helaine Meresman Barnett, and of the late Janis Meresman Goldman, loving father-inlaw of Victor Barnett and Michael Goldman, devoted grandfather and great grandfather. Fond memories will remain. Adele Suslak and Family MERESMAN-Harry. Our ''Uncle Harry,'' dear friend to Morrises all, will be deeply missed. Jeff, Dona, Donny, Carole Lee\n"

      "Strong Job Creation Shows The Economy Is Still Robust Another big burst of job growth in February showed that the nation's economy was still on a roll while wage pressures remained subdued. Driven by booms in construction and consumer spending, employers added 275,000 new jobs to their payrolls. Since Thanksgiving, the economy has been adding jobs at the staggering pace of 3.2 million a year. Even so, the unemployment rate edged up one-tenth of a percentage point, to 4.4 percent. The strong jobs creation figures touched off a rally in the stock market and sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a new high of 9,736.08. Traders also drove long-term interest rates down.

      "WHERE THE RAINBOW ENDS By Jameson Currier. Overlook, $24.95. From the heady, sexually liberated days of the late 1970's to the cautious, AIDS-aware moderation of the 1990's, Jameson Currier's first novel tracks a group of lovers and friends from their exuberant early days in Manhattan to their accelerated, often tragic, maturity. The book's narrator, Robbie Taylor, is something of an outsider, a good listener who seeks a steady, reliable lover in the city's gay bars and bathhouses, where most of the men are in search of either quick sex or an open, uncommitted relationship. Whether in East Village nightclubs or on Fire Island's beaches, Currier's men explore newfound freedom and a slightly more accepting society as they revel in what seems like an endless drug-fueled party. Then AIDS sweeps in, cooling passion and heartlessly, pointlessly culling the group. Robbie, ''incriminated with health,'' must watch as his lover, Nathan, and other close friends fall sick and drift toward death. Robbie finds new hope when he moves from New York to Los Angeles; he takes part in the artificial insemination of his lesbian friend, Denise, and then, with his new lover, helps to raise the child. Currier is adept at drawing a fine line between the erotic and the tragic, and at telling stories that ''although personal, are also the stories of our community.'' Currier's characters, seen mainly from Robbie's observant but undemanding perspective, sometimes lack depth. But they are clearly meant to stand for more than just individuals; Currier's novel feels like the fictionalized history of a generation of gay men. Erik Burns\n",

      "LILA SAYS By Chimo. Scribner, $20. Of all the genres least in need of invention, moralizing pornography is high on the list. Nevertheless, French readers were entranced by ''Lila Says,'' purporting to be a narrative by the pseudonymous Chimo, who is supposed to have scrawled it in ballpoint pen in two notebooks and sent it to publishers through an attorney. Set in one of Paris's grim urban housing projects, this slender book is about how Chimo, a disadvantaged 19-year-old Arab boy, becomes erotically transfixed by Lila, a blond, 16-year-old Roman Catholic vixen. Lila begins telling Chimo about her various sexual fantasies; later, on a moving bicycle, she performs acts on the lucky Arab lad that would be difficult for even the most gifted circus performer. This amatory improbability, and the fact that impoverished young men don't often have attorneys, are clues that ''Lila Says'' is not an authentic diamond in the rough but a calculatingly polished literary conceit. Another is Chimo's penchant -- in between sessions of writing his book at an abandoned construction site by candlelight -- for ruminating on the oppression of the underclass, a theme that seems to turn him on much more than his acrobatic pal does. Once Lila claims to have had sex with the Devil, things pretty much go downhill for her in the religiously volatile projects.

      "AROUND 300 B.C., Euclid wrote the book on geometry. Twenty-three centuries later, two 14-year-old students in Westport may have rewritten a chapter; they discovered an alternate solution to one of the ancient mathematician's classic theoems. During the summer of 1995 while working for extra credit in an accelerated math course at Greens Farms Academy in Westport, David Goldenheim and Dan Litchfield stumbled on an original approach to equal partitioning, a corollary to Proposition 10 in the sixth book of ''Elements,'' the 13-volume work on mathematics that Euclid created. Given a line of any length, Euclid presents a universal geometric method for subdividing it into any number of equal parts. Mr. Goldenheim and Mr. Litchfield, now seniors who will attend Harvard University next fall, still regard their accomplishment and the reaction it produced with some astonishment.\n",

      "INCUBUS By Ann Arensberg. 322 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $24. IN the spring and summer of 1974, the little hamlet of Dry Falls, Me., suffers some oddities. They begin trivially enough, with herbs found strewn in the graveyard, candles stolen from the altar. Then an August heat wave descends in April. Stillbirths, false pregnancies and monstrous births occur among the farm animals. The crops parch, lettuce and spinach seed prematurely, peaches wizen, even the pond grasses wilt. Marriages likewise wither and deform. One after another the men fall into sexual malaise, and one after another their wives come to Henry Lieber, rector of the Episcopal church of St. Anthony the Hermit, for the psychotherapeutic counseling expected of a modern pastor.\n",

      "Angela Wilson, artist, in her 50's My home is dripping with sculptures, all over the walls. The whole thing is absolutely packed. Everything has to be stuffed into three closets, and if I didn't have this, I don't know what I would do. There is literally no floor space, so these sculptures had to go to storage because they took up a lot of space. They depict my children when they were small, 6 and 9. I really wanted to capture them at that age, and I wanted to do it in sepia tones so it would be stuck in time -- they're wearing their favorite clothes at the time -- and there would be a kind of unreality. I've got the best of both worlds, my children as they were then and as I have them now. Jody DelGiorno, 28 My roommate fell in love, and we had that conversation in the bathroom one morning: I think you ought to find another place to live. So I put everything in storage and was staying with friends, more or less living out of storage. I came here to change a couple of times, walk in here dressed like this and walk out with a suit on. When I found a place to live, I realized how much I love this place and the convenience. I'm a freelance film director, and I have all my production supplies here -- foam core, boards, gels, rope, bubble wrap, spring clips -- the supplies you use from day to day. Where I live now, it's two flights of stairs just to get anything up and down. But with this place, you have an elevator next to a bunch of dollies on wheels, where you can go right to a truck bed if you need to transport heavy stuff. David Perez shadi, 32, with Mizuo Peck, 21 I've had storage for six years. Whatever doesn't fit in the closet goes in storage, because a clear apartment is a clear mind. The clutter, it keeps your mind cluttered. When you start going through stuff, you realize the sentimental value and why you haven't thrown it out in 10 years. And now I'm actually in regression and getting the toys I couldn't get when I was younger: I've got a box of Spawn, Star Wars and Kiss dolls and Planet of the Apes. They're all worth something, but usually they're too much trouble to sell and too cool to get rid of. It's stuff my mother wouldn't buy for me, so I buy it now. No one can tell me no. You just can't play with them all at once. This is like a toy closet. Ray Lustica, 74 What I collect from Social Security is enough to pay the storage rent; that's about it. I'm caught between the circumstances of the high rents and having to live. I've had no housing for about 13 years. I try to make the best of it. I keep my food in here for the weekend and the evenings -- the bread suspended from the top of the ceiling so that the mice can't get at it. I've got clothing here, some odds and ends, records. There's a map of Central Park, in case I ever wander up there again. There's cardboard, in case I need to pack up my stuff when I do move, if and when. I'd rather have an apartment than this crummy warehouse here -- to get back where I can enjoy my books and my records and relax, a place where I can just sit down if I feel tired.\n",

      "TO a nonartist, pastel seems a daunting medium even more difficult than watercolor. It would appear that a false move would be impossible to get right. Plus, there is the general pastiness of pastel: its texture often gets noticed before the subject matter, and not every subject is fit for it. But the positive side is that in the right hands pastel suits landscape perfectly. Its inherent evanescence can capture weather and fleeting effects like dappled sunlight. The long marriage of this medium and the genre is being renewed at the Pelham Art Center here in ''The Changing Landscape of Pastel.'' As the title hints, venerable ways of working give way to freer ones. A comparison might be made with jazz when musicians play an old standard, then burst into improvisation.\n",

      "UNTIL just the other day, ''contentious'' was not a word associated with ''Washington Week in Review,'' the solid or stolid weekly PBS get-together of mainstream journalists who never raised their voices in disagreement. While over at the cable stations, a gabble of strong-lunged television personalities were making reputations with passionate encounters over the latest crowd-pleaser, ''Washington Week'' kept doing what seemed in the cable commotion to come unnaturally, reporting on subjects of consequence that its panelists knew something about. But then Ken Bode, who had been the program's moderator since 1994 (and continues to serve as dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism), quit or was bumped from his television job, along with his producer Elizabeth Piersol. The details are not agreed on, but it appears that Dalton Delan, the new head of programming at WETA, the Washington public station responsible for ''Washington Week,'' was suggesting adding ingredients like man-on-the-street interviews, appearances by students and liberal-conservative clashes to give the half-hour what has been described as more ''edge'' and ''attitude.''\n",

      "BRIGHT ANGEL TIME By Martha McPhee. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13. Set in the 1970's, this first novel is narrated by a thoughtful 8-year-old girl who struggles to make sense of her family's chaotic life on the road after her abandoned mother is lured to Big Sur by an itinerant therapist to the well-to-do. The result is ''a hard and shining artifact of personal and social upheaval,'' Walter Kirn wrote in the Book Review in 1997. CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC: Dispatches From the Unfinished Civil War By Tony Horwitz. Vintage Departures, $14. A former Wall Street Journal reporter and Civil War buff takes up with a troop of hard-core battle re-enactors, toughing it out in the field and tracking down secession-related controversies and die-hard keepers of the faith throughout the South. Last year our reviewer, Roy Blount Jr., found this to be a ''splendid commemoration of the war and its legacy'' as well as ''an eyes-open, humorously no-nonsense survey of complicated Americans.'' CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY: Joshua Chamberlain, William Oates, and the American Civil War, by Mark Perry (Penguin, $15.95), focuses on the eventful careers of two rival commanders at Gettysburg -- one from Maine, the other Alabama -- who started out as poor farm boys and wound up in politics. The result is ''an ambitious . . . history of the North and South from before the war to the end of Reconstruction,'' Frederick Allen wrote here in 1998. ''The author reaches far beyond their own lives to capture the complex spirit of the times.'' AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST By Iain Pears. Berkley, $7.99. This intricate literary thriller about the murder of an Oxford don in Restoration England -- and the far greater crime to which it is linked -- unfolds through the voices of four very different narrators. ''Pears, with a painstaking, almost forensic attention to detail, constructs his world like a master painter of trompe l'oeil,'' Andrew Miller wrote here last year. THE EDGE OF THE SEA By Rachel Carson. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14. Seven years before the classic ''Silent Spring,'' the author turned her formidable gaze on the narrow strip of sea bottom that ebbs and flows with the tides, and the rich web of life thriving along the Atlantic coastline. ''Carson's book is beautifully written,'' Jonathan N. Leonard wrote in the Book Review in 1955. ''People who get bored by too much lolling on beaches should read it as a guidebook.'' RACHEL CARSON: The Writer at Work, by Paul Brooks (Sierra Club, $18), uses hefty selections from Carson's published and unpublished writings to track her career as both a pioneering environmentalist and a dedicated writer. In 1972 our reviewer, Josephine Johnson, called this a ''rich and readable work.'' A PATCHWORK PLANET By Anne Tyler. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12.95. Barnaby Gaitlin is a chronic underachiever who is estranged from his family and driven by a hunger to peer into other people's lives. Yet his inner turmoil is accompanied by sudden attacks of clarity. Last year our reviewer, Carol Shields, called this a ''wonderful novel . . . that repays our always delighted attention.'' TENDER AT THE BONE: Growing Up at the Table By Ruth Reichl. Broadway, $13. In recalling how a life of eating, waitressing and cooking led her to become a food writer, the departing restaurant critic for The Times (soon to be editor in chief of Gourmet) focuses on the characters of those she loves: mainly her flamboyant mother and her mild-mannered father. Praising this ''effortlessly entertaining'' memoir here last year, Paul Levy said ''Reichl is . . . witty, fair-minded, brave and a wonderful writer.'' NIGHT LETTERS By Robert Dessaix. Picador USA, $13. In a hotel room in Venice, a middle-aged Australian with a terminal illness writes to a friend about his meandering journey through Europe and his search for meaning. Last year our reviewer, Patrick Farrell, admired ''the wry, chatty, surprisingly cheerful voice in which he discourses on heaven and hell, seduction and sex.'' THE DAY OF CREATION By J. G. Ballard. Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $13. In a parched central African nation, an obsessed British doctor fulfills his dream of creating a ''third Nile.'' ''Ballard constructs a moody and well-modeled landscape with as fine a writerly intelligence as we might hope for,'' Samuel R. Delany wrote in these pages in 1988. In War Fever ($10), a collection of Ballard's short fiction reissued by the same publisher, Beirut becomes a laboratory for the study of warfare and Ronald Reagan is recalled to the White House, only to have news reports about his health overshadow World War III. ''Far more rigorous and fastidious than Jorge Luis Borges or Italo Calvino, Mr. Ballard keeps impeccably cool,'' Ursula K. Le Guin said here in 1991. BONOBO: The Forgotten Ape By Frans de Waal. Photographs by Frans Lanting. University of California, $24.95. A primatologist explores the striking differences between these so-called pygmy chimpanzees, who freely use sex to resolve tension, and their more familiar cousins. In 1997 in these pages, David Papineau called this an ''elegant photo-essay.'' Scott Veale\n",

      "To climb the hillside slums, or favelas, rising between the Copacabana and Ipanema districts of Rio de Janeiro is to journey back through time, from the modern era to the preindustrial age. At the bottom stand spacious homes, with running water, electricity and glossy ceramic tiles. At the top of the hill is a neighborhood known as Vietnam. Dangerous as a war zone, it is a place where drug traffickers wage frequent gun battles for control of the lucrative markets below. In Vietnam, homes are made of mud and sticks, and light comes from candles, the moon and the stars. Midway up the hill is the home of Almir and Tania de Souza, a narrow space the size of a small child's bedroom. The couple live with their infant son, David, and Tania's children from a previous marriage: Tais, 6, and Manuela, 4. Four months ago, Almir, 35, an out-of-work suit salesman, laid a corrugated tin roof between two cement-block houses, cobbling together a structure over two days using plywood he lifted from a construction site. Inside, two layers of rug remnants on the floor make a soft bed for the children. The compartments in one hollowed-out cement block serve as a kind of medicine chest for razors, toothbrushes and stray notes. Almir built his makeshift-looking home surprisingly well; despite driving rain and ocean winds that periodically send houses crashing and sliding down the hill, the Souza house is dry and does not even rattle, says Tania, who is 24 and works off and on as a maid.\n"

      "A HOME IN THE HEART OF A CITY By Kathleen Hirsch. North Point, $24. Boston's Jamaica Plain has long been considered a model for a workable neighborhood with a strong sense of community. Racially and socioeconomically diverse, J.P. -- as it is known throughout the city -- boasts an eclectic mix of residents and business people who have dedicated themselves to keeping the area vibrant and viable. In ''A Home in the Heart of the City,'' Kathleen Hirsch has written a heartfelt profile of this working-class enclave. She chronicles the devotion of the people who put themselves on the line to maintain municipal services, develop new programs, reach the disenfranchised and make Jamaica Plain an attractive place to live. (For some reason, according to Hirsch, these citizens work tirelessly for the community but throw up their hands when it comes to the public schools, which she describes disparagingly.) Many of the individual tales Hirsch relates about Jamaica Plainers are engaging; unfortunately, however, the writing is facile and formulaic. Too many of the ''heroes'' of J.P. have become committed and empowered and have ''never looked back.'' A transformation occurs, making aspects of the community ''magical,'' providing ''attachment'' and ''tranquillity,'' and able to provide establishments that ''welcome all who come through its doors.'' Nevertheless, as a tribute to a city neighborhood and to the grass-roots efforts of a group of ordinary citizens, ''A Home in the Heart of the City'' is effective, even instructional.

It is a reissue of a 1952 recording, with Fritz Stiedry conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Metropolitan Opera Association, as it was then called (Masterworks Heritage MH2K 60652; two CD's). Stiedry, who was born in Austria, was an eminent opera conductor. And the cast would seem to be impeccable. Eleanor Steber, one of the most acclaimed Mozart sopranos ever, and the respected mezzo-soprano Blanche Thebom are the sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella. Ferrando and Guglielmo, the self-absorbed suitors of those endearingly inconstant women, are sung by Richard Tucker, in his tenorial prime, and the beguiling baritone Frank Guarrera. The soprano Roberta Peters, captured in her early days as a fresh-voiced soubrette, is the clever maid Despina. The robust bass Lorenzo Alvary sings the cynical bachelor Don Alfonso.\n",

      "It takes steady nerves to infiltrate a religious cult whose charismatic leader preaches ''the cleansing nature of fire'' -- and whose members live in a wooden compound. That's the volatile situation that Anne Waverly puts herself in, in Laurie R. King's nail-biter thriller A DARKER PLACE (Bantam, $23.95), when the scholarly professor of religion agrees to take on one last undercover job for the F.B.I. Operating in the guise of ''Ana Wakefield,'' a middle-aged schoolteacher on a quest for spiritual enlightenment, Anne insinuates herself into the Arizona chapter of Change, where she eventually learns that the group mantra, ''Great heat, great hope,'' is more than a catchy phrase. King's solid research into alternative religious sects makes the desert commune feel like a real place, while her taut pacing insures that an air of menace hangs over the strange rituals that go on there. But the strongest appeal of the story lies in its superb characters, especially the children who become Anne's charges. And although her contacts with the F.B.I. seem a bit haphazard, Anne is the best character of all, a mature woman who is both smart and courageous but flawed by an emotional need that puts her in grave danger. Just the kind of person to rescue the psychological suspense genre from its surfeit of perfect heroines. . . .\n",

Studying these statistics, economists try to discern important trends in national consciousness. They might be better off taking a stroll through a Home Depot. Far more than buying a new home, the fixation on elevating one's current home into a design showplace -- and doing it by hand -- has become a secular religion. According to the Remodelors Council, by around 2010 Americans will spend more on improving homes than on buying them.

But the restaurant, at 206 West 23d Street near Seventh Avenue, has come under the lash lately from the local community board, which says residents have complained about the place. The issue, the board says, is not what goes on inside, but the noise and the crowds. On Wednesday, Community Board 4 voted to object to a renewal of the restaurant's liquor license. Although the State Liquor Authority decided to renew the license on Monday, board members were hoping the agency would reconsider, William Kelly, the district manager, said.\n",

      "Despite all the environmental precautions, interstate trash fights -- like the one between Virginia and New York -- are back on the front page. Here's why. Now that we're recycling, shouldn't there be less of the stuff to dump? Nationwide, about a quarter of all trash -- and much more in some cities -- is recycled, but there are fewer and fewer places to put the nonrecyclables. In 1990, the Federal Government declared that garbage dumps had to install strict environmental safeguards, and fewer than half the country's dumps were left in business. Fewer dumps -- that sounds like a good thing. It would be, except that now trash has to be hauled a lot farther. National trash companies are busily seeking out ever cheaper places to put refuse. The typical American throws out a staggering three-quarters of a ton of trash a year, and to landfill that amount in New England or New York can cost two or three times as much as it would to dump it in the Midwest, South or, cheapest of all, out near the Rockies somewhere. Is that what's making Virginia so reluctant to take New York's trash? Not the cost of dumping so much as the potential hazards of hauling it around, which get a lot more likely the farther the trash has to go. Last month, after a traffic accident, several tons of genuine New York City refuse spilled all over a Virginia highway. Waste-industry executives insist these mishaps are rare, but even so, they leave a strong impression. But aren't huge smelly landfills a bigger concern than occasional spills? From an environmental perspective, perhaps -- but not from a political perspective. Newer dumps tend to be built in remote, economically depressed areas, far from most constituents' homes. The highways and waterways that trash haulers use to reach them, on the other hand, are well traveled. In the past year, interstate trash transit has become a hot-button issue in many states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. All this uproar must be murder on the big trash companies. Not really. People generate junk whether politicians are yelling at each other or not, and the big companies are aggressively expanding. While Mayor Giuliani and Virginia's Governor, James Gilmore, were making a stink, one Wall Street analyst reported that Waste Management Inc., the nation's biggest trash-disposal company, was raising its dumping fees by 40 percent. The company's own projections were more prudent. Regardless, competitors are expected to follow suit. C.J. Hughes\n",

''Kiss today goodbye'' is the first line of one of the show's signature songs, ''What I Did for Love.'' And the bruising effects of every ineffectual acting teacher who has ever dispensed cliches were summed up for all time when Diana Morales sang, ''I felt nothing.''\n",

      "Kevin Fitzgerald was a bouncer for the Rolling Stones when Keith Richards told him to expand his horizons. ''When Keith Richards tells you to get a grip, it's a real eye-opener,'' said Dr. Fitzgerald, who became a veterinarian. Now he's a star with fans of his own on ''Emergency Vet,'' a half-hour program on the Animal Planet cable channel (Sunday at 8:30 P.M. Eastern time, Monday through Thursday at 10 P.M.). Filmed at Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver, ''Emergency Vet'' is a sort of real-life ''E.R.'' with pets for patients, complete with resident hunks who deal with challenges from kennel cough to amputation. Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Steven Petersen, a veterinary surgeon with George Clooney good looks (left), receive regular marriage proposals, letters and E-mail from their viewers, who total 46 million. ''They aren't afraid to be tender, and that captures your heart,'' said Monica Rizzo, who profiled Dr. Petersen for People magazine's ''Sexiest Men'' issue in November. ''Dr. Petersen's, like, a hero,'' said Roxanne Baker, 16, of Lubbock, Texas, recalling a time he saved a dog with a condition known as twisted stomach. ''He's so take-charge. He's really calm and level-headed.'' Maureen Onofrio, 40, a fan in West Haven, Conn., recently confessed her crush on Dr. Fitzgerald to her husband. ''Kevin has an emotional maturity that I find extremely sexy,'' she said. ''It's flattering,'' Dr. Fitzgerald said. ''But we're just vets. Rock stars get sexy pictures of supermodels. We get Polaroids of women with their tarantulas.'' ELLEN TIEN\n",

Her voice is healthy by virtue of what is coming to be known in the world as the American technique of singing. She can negotiate three or four languages. Most likely, she has played the piano since prepubescence. Italy, as a voice teacher from Lucca once told me, has relatively few pianos, much less people who learn music from playing them. Then why is it that Americans (with splendid exceptions) are valued internationally more for their usefulness and versatility than for intimate personal contact with Verdi or Puccini? And why do Italians, often with sketchy musical backgrounds and faulty technique, sometimes penetrate their roles more convincingly.

The men sat in metal lawn chairs, trying to talk over the caws of bickering crows; the boys hunched nearby over a beeping electronic game. Inside, the women of the family squatted in the kitchen, rolling out dough for chapatis. They slapped the flat circles into a pan, then lifted them with tongs directly onto a burner on the floor, where they puffed into fragrant balloons of bread. In the traditional Indian way, three generations of the Singh family live together here under the same farmhouse roof in Daulah, their ancestral village in the northern state of Haryana. Like most of their countrymen, they still scratch out a living from the soil. The wheat for chapatis comes from the Singhs' 10 acres of land; the nightly glass of milk and the dung that fuels their cooking fires comes from two fat, gleaming water buffaloes.\n",

Preserved lemons are subtle, and they are kind. They deliver a taste far removed from fresh lemons, whose acidity can summon a grimace.

The redbuds are budding, the daisies are dancing in the warm breezes and the sweet scent of mountain laurel fills the air. And that is not necessarily happy news for travelers who visit Austin and the Texas Hill Country to admire the spring wildflowers. Because of unusual warmth so far this year, the peak for spring wildflowers -- typically the last two weeks of March and the first two weeks of April -- is about three weeks early. ''By the second week in March, I suspect we will have peaked out,'' said Flo Oxley, botanist at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin. Central Texas is also unusually dry, which could reduce both the number and the duration of blooms unless it rains soon. ''I still think it's going to be a beautiful spring,'' Ms. Oxley said, but added, ''Don't be disappointed if you don't see oceans and oceans of bluebonnets.''\n",

      "THROWIM WAY LEG Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds -- On the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea. By Tim Flannery. Illustrated. 326 pp. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press. $25. ''IT is always slightly unnerving arriving at a new location'' in New Guinea, Tim Flannery says. ''You have no idea what the locals will be like or how you will be received.'' What an understatement! This man walked alone into a village for the first time and overheard three locals agreeing to kill him, and that is far from the most threatening situation he found himself in. The title of his book, ''Throwim Way Leg,'' is pidgin for going on a journey. Flannery, a celebrated mammalogist and paleontologist at the Australian Museum in Sydney, made 15 long research excursions into New Guinea beginning in 1981, when he was 26; in a dozen years he identified at least 17 new species of mammals, and his ''Mammals of New Guinea'' (1990) is the standard scientific guide. But ''Throwim Way Leg'' is more than an account of his fieldwork. It is an enthralling introduction to the mountain people of New Guinea -- unimaginably remote, charming, cunning, cruel, subtle and appealing -- and to their magnificent land. Flannery is not always an eloquent writer, but his evocations of the New Guinean landscape carry you away.\n",

      "COUNTRY has long been packaged as the classical music of simple American folks. The transformation of hillbilly entertainment into an official repository of our national traditions has extended from the fancy naming of the Grand Ole Opry in 1927 to the appointment of William Ivey, the director of the Country Music Hall of Fame, to the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998. Not only Nashville's music industry, but also the ''alternative'' country made by rock- and folk-schooled rebels can be discouragingly orthodox, its vintage trappings turning cultural preservation into historical tourism. Yet country music is also grounded in dislocation -- in the stories of people facing upheaval in their home towns, their families, their daily life. This is a modern music, tied like the blues to the journeys of working people across America and the encroachment of the city on rural life. The poor wayfaring stranger is as much a honky-tonk cliche as Mama making cornbread, and as country's patina grows ever more nostalgic, even that character's vagrancy becomes strangely fixed. Exile has become another form of home in country, invoked with a warm glow.\n",

When Louis Kossuth and his entourage came to New York to promote the cause of Hungarian independence from Austria, Mr. Genin presented each of them with a black felt hat adorned with a single black feather. The refugees were seen wearing them as long as they remained in New York, and Mr. Genin sold thousands of ''Kossuth hats.''

This city of just over a million people is just the right distance from most of the state's population centers to feel like a real journey, and it's got just the right number of attractions to last two or three days at an easy pace. Plus, it's refreshingly different from almost every other place in Texas, a kind of Spanish colonial theme park with good restaurants.\n",

      "HANK SNOW. The Singing Ranger, as he's known. One of the top figures in country music, he recorded for RCA from 1934 to 1979 when he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Like so many of country's pioneers, he's pretty much ignored these days, yet the simplicity and breadth of his work still has the power to speak to true country fans. Snow's worth knowing about, but he has only three albums in print in this country at the moment, a Best of the Best, an Essential, and one called Snow Country. They contain more or less the same tracks, but those of us who know his music realize there's more to hear, and there is. So, to get to know the Singing Ranger, you could drop $13 on one of the compilations or go a little further: for a mere $887.42 (from amazon.com, not including tax and shipping), one could buy six boxed sets of CD's that give you everything, including transcriptions done for the Thesaurus company during World War II for the Armed Forces Network.

In sober but more engaging fact, the Cooper Gallery is displaying ''Women in Wax,'' abstract paintings by two young artists who differ in almost everything except their use of the once rare, now fairly common medium of encaustic, in which pigments are mixed with wax and fixed by the application of heat. As a technique, encaustic is far more venerable than oil painting; in ancient Egypt, for example, it was used in the astonishing portraits found in the mummy cases of Fayum. Later, it was nearly forgotten as an artistic medium, but since Jasper Johns revived it in the mid-1950's, more and more artists have begun to use it, among them Seren Morey and Lynda Ray. The contrasts between them show just how flexible the medium can be.

That evening he gave what would be his last public performance, a disturbing solo recital, ''Marriage With God,'' at a hotel in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where he and his family had taken up wartime residence. For the next 45 days, sometimes all night, the 29-year-old Nijinsky wrote feverishly in four leather-bound school exercise books. He stopped abruptly on March 4, when his wife, Romola, and her family, took him to Zurich to see the noted psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler. The verdict: schizophrenia, a diagnostic term Bleuler had recently coined. This doomed Nijinsky to a course of recurrent hospitalization and extreme therapies that continued until his death of renal failure on April 8, 1950, in London.\n",

The conflicts stem from ancient hatreds, people say. They can be buried for years or decades, but they always return. Though it is dangerous to underestimate the weight of history, it can be just as mistaken to overestimate it. Indeed, ancient hatreds in the Balkans have produced cycles of killing and revenge. That provides the climate for more explosions of hate. But combustion requires the addition of other factors very much of the present. For lasting peace in the Balkans, and in other regions with similarly troubled pasts, the world must be able to spot and prevent those conditions before violence begins.\n",

      "STANDING in the courtyard of Harold Becker's Hollywood Hills home is a 10-foot-tall wooden frame that bears a striking resemblance to a guillotine. Halfway down, however, rests not a murderously sharp blade but rather an old-fashioned camera, its black bellows extending nearly three feet from the lens to an 11-by-14-inch glass panel at the rear. It looks like a piece of elegant furniture, perfectly appropriate for a house belonging to the director of ''Sea of Love'' and ''City Hall.'' But more than 30 years ago, before he got into movies, when he was a commercial photographer in New York, Mr. Becker restored this 1920's camera to working order. He used it to take a series of abstract portraits of the female form. Thanks to the camera's unusually large format, the texture of the skin and the contours of the body could be revealed in surreal detail. In a photograph titled ''Nude Study No. 3,'' for example, a viewer first sees a vast map of tiny cracks in the skin of a model's shaved leg before being surprised by a harsh callous protruding from her heel.\n",

      "SLACKJAW By Jim Knipfel. Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, $22.95. Jim Knipfel spares no one the sting of his caustic humor in his memoir, ''Slackjaw'': ''Throughout my life, I realize, I've recognized things in myself that were worth mocking. I started mocking them before anyone else had the chance. What's more, my own mockery was much crueler and colder and funnier than anything anyone else would ever dare say.'' Knipfel certainly never succumbs to any soft emotions as he traces his three-decade descent into blindness. Although he had been gradually going blind from birth, and began wearing glasses at the age of 3, retinitis pigmentosa was not diagnosed until he was well into his 20's. Knipfel also suffered from a brain lesion that caused seizures and uncontrollable bouts of rage. His life seems to have focused on survival as he assuaged feelings of hopelessness with alcohol and with membership in groups like the Nihilist Workers' Party, bent mostly on stirring up the people of Madison, Wis., where he attended college. Later, not wanting to take a job, Knipfel toured the blood banks of Madison, donating to several each week. Now a columnist and staff writer at The New York Press, a weekly newspaper, Knipfel says his physical ailments were not the cause of his self-stinging, absurdist response to life. In fact, he claims not to have felt bothered much by his disabilities. He describes himself as simply having been born with an intractable belligerence that caused him to take pleasure in doing anything but what was expected of him. The facts he presents supply reason enough not to take Knipfel at his word, and midway through the memoir, we find ourselves wishing for more dimension in his relentlessly ironic ''comic book hell.''

      "Other writers have related the brave stories of Jewish immigrant pioneers who made their way from tiny villages in Eastern Europe to the vast open spaces and new possibilities of the American West, but Ruhama Veltfort, in her impressive first novel, THE PROMISED LAND (Milkweed, $23.95), recasts the tale in a spiritual dimension. She delves into the religious yearnings of a group of travelers, bound together by faith and family, who flee the pogroms and poverty of 19th-century Poland. Here the inner adventure is as striking as the landscape they navigate. Yitzhak, a gentle rabbi with mystical leanings and large visions, heads the group of migrants, which includes his wife, Chana, a woman of quiet piety whose practical bent balances her husband's loftiness; his twin sister, who is able to see his dreams; her husband, whose religious conviction is tested many times over; and a fiddler whose tunes take on American rhythms as they travel. In their ecstatic prayer they find solace, singing the songs of Yitzhak's enigmatic rebbe, whose deathbed message inspired their journey. After a sojourn in St. Louis with some wealthy Jewish merchants whose ownership of slaves surprises them, they set out for Oregon, hoping for freedom and a better future in the western wilderness. Veltfort, who is the granddaughter of the psychoanalyst Otto Rank, tells this story in chapters from Chana's and Yitzhak's alternating perspectives. Their path is filled with violence and loss, but comic moments also lighten the narrative; in one memorable scene, they are introduced to the earthly pleasures of watermelon. Sandee Brawarsky\n",

''Earth on Her Hands'', a book by Starr Ockenga (1988), profiled Jane as one of America's leading women gardeners. The chapter on Jane focused on her well-known bonsai collection. Jane has left her bonsai collection to the Monmouth County Park System, to be displayed at Deep Cut Park, Middletown. She accompanied her husband, George, who was ViceChairman of Citibank, on many trips on bank business throughout the world. She was a member of the Rumson Garden Club, the Rumson Country Club, and the Sea Bright Beach Club.\n",

It was during this episode, which took place when I was 15, that I first understood how easily our dreams of a more perfect order can founder on the shoals of everyday life. In my family's case, the dream of a more perfect order was supplied by a man named William Machado, the interior decorator my mother chose from the pages of a home-design magazine to redo the dated and gloomy Manhattan co-op my family had moved into the year before, making the big step up from our ranch house on Long Island. In memory, Machado looks exactly like Jerome Robbins, with the same scrupulously clipped salt-and-pepper beard, the erect dancer's bearing and an austere, somewhat formal manner not at all in keeping with the times.

      "WHEN Tobias Perse and Craig Damraurer, first-time filmmakers, set out to make a documentary last fall, they chose their topic with a nod to the adage that authors should write about what they know. Both Mr. Perse, 28, and Mr. Damraurer, 29, are slightly bald. In their film, tentatively titled ''Bald: The Movie,'' they plan to string together interviews with 30 or 40 men and women to shed light on the complex and intense opinions and emotions that surface over the subject of hair loss. ''You have feelings of weakness, anguish, suffering, mortality, humiliation,'' Mr. Perse said recently as he sat in his apartment on East 10th Street, where he and Mr. Damraurer have set up a production office. ''And honest feelings are what make a story interesting to us.''\n",

Earlier, this black dentist showed off another passion: a 1,000-bottle wine cellar in his home, which is on a leafy block in Scarsdale, N.Y. Six years ago, Harold Doley, the first black to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, bought a 35-room mansion originally built by Madam C. J. Walker, the first black self-made female millionaire in America. She amassed a fortune from hair care products and beauty schools.

Knicks games had a distinct tone, set by the thumping elbows of Charles Oakley whenever an opponent strayed into the lane, usually followed by a high-pitched yelp as the player hit the floor and conducted a count of ribs or teeth. But the sound has changed this year in Oakley's absence, and the monotonous, new-age pitch of calm has not sat any better with Van Gundy than the team's four losses in its last five games. Van Gundy put the Knicks through a walk-through today in preparation for a Sunday afternoon meeting with the Nets.

      "THE Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, who died three years ago, often likened his pieces to gardens: specifically Japanese gardens, made to be admired at a strolling pace, with frequent stops to enjoy, perhaps, the foliage of a tree, or a flower, or a spider's web, or a distant view. Certainly, the analogy fits almost everything he wrote, whatever the style (and there were many), but his music's customary slow andante may have come from a deeper inkling into how we listen. The irregular amble is the tempo of one thought supplanting another, each lasting for the normal extent of time we think of as the present, which is about two or three seconds. Music behaving this way can seem to go at its own pace, because it is going at ours. Nothing hurries it on from loitering at the speed of our unfocused expectation. There are no commanding rhythms, no structural requirements to be met. We hear this, then something like this, then something like the last this. By comparison with Takemitsu's music, Debussy's sounds fiercely directed.\n",

They are all in Southern California, which has been booming for nearly a century now. We are currently enjoying a time of prosperity, which may sometimes seem hard to believe as we observe continuing industrial layoffs and plant closings, but then we can also observe the regular transformation of exurban cornfields into tracts of $300,000 neo-colonial four-bedroom homes with state-of-the-art kitchens. We can also be reassured by statistics: according to Brian Carey, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a mere 1.14 percent of American homes were in a state of foreclosure in 1998. That, however, translates into the more sobering figure of 500,000 homes, half of which will end up being repossessed. If each housed, on average, a family of four, that means more than a million people last year had to find storage for their furniture, check into motels or arrange to sleep on friends' couches, figure out ways to go about their lives while avoiding the subject of their credit history -- and that's only counting those capable of getting a mortgage in the first place. Some of them undoubtedly brought this upon themselves, throwing their dollars at gaming tables or psychoactive substances or dubious investments, but many others got sick, got old, got redundant, got depressed or just plain got behind.\n",

''I was going to make a mean, vicious little comedy about dating,'' said Mr. Berkowitz, who at the time was both recently divorced and professionally stumped in Hollywood. The resulting movie, ''20 Dates,'' nudges real life along by orchestrating its humorous situations. Closer in technique to MTV's ''Real World'' than to ''Sherman's March,'' it is cinema verite that has slipped on a banana peel.\n",

      "President Clinton put Republicans on the defensive when he proposed to tap most of the budget surplus in the next 15 years to shore up Social Security and pay down the national debt, not to cut taxes as they wanted. Most voter surveys show that Americans embrace Mr. Clinton's choice. Now, in their first formal response to the President's budget, the Republicans have tried to outdo him by setting aside even more money for Social Security than Mr. Clinton proposed. They would also defer their tax cuts for at least two years. Their new approach is a step in the right direction. But it has many flaws, including unacceptable cuts in Medicare and other domestic spending. The Republican move reflects a clear recognition that the party's lawmakers cannot be seen as less than zealous about protecting Social Security. At present, the system generates a surplus. But while economists disagree on the timing, it will plunge into insolvency as baby boomers retire. For many years the Social Security surplus has been used to pay for other spending in the budget, and the Republicans now say they want to end that practice right away. The problem with such a step is that, as some Republicans have acknowledged, it would require steep budget cuts next year. The Republicans have already said they want spending increases in defense and some education programs, so the cuts would have to come in myriad other programs that they have not yet specified.\n",

      "LIKE Verdi's ''Falstaff,'' which preceded it on the boards of La Scala by nearly three and a half decades, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's ''Sly'' plays fast and loose with Shakespeare, in the process enriching the material almost past recognition. Unlike Falstaff, who marched straight from Shakespeare's quill onto the Great Stage of Archetypes, Sly is a character even his begetter promptly forgot. But Giovacchino Forzano, a man of letters and the theater active at La Scala in the first half of this century, saw in him untapped potential. A play resulted, and eventually an opera, which receives its belated American premiere on Wednesday at the Washington Opera. Jose Carreras, absent from the American operatic stage since 1987, stars. Who is Sly? In ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' a drunken beggar and occasional tinker. In most modern productions of the play, he never appears. But in the full text, you will find him in the very first line, brawling with the hostess, refusing to pay his bill (shades of Falstaff with Mistress Quickly in ''Henry IV''). Moments later, he collapses in a stupor. Discovering him thus, a lord has him transported to the castle, dressed up and, when he awakens, treated as a nobleman at last restored to sanity after years of madness. He is reunited with his ''wife'': a pageboy in a dress. By chance, a troupe of strolling players shows up (shades of ''Hamlet'') and is put to work performing ''The Taming of the Shrew.''\n",

      "WINGTIPS By Avery Chenoweth. Johns Hopkins, $22.50. Aptly named the Goodpastures, the family at the center of Avery Chenoweth's debut collection of nine linked stories is a solidly moral, patrician Southern clan. Even the family's most wayward member, Stuart Goodpasture Sr., who leaves his wife and four children for a ''perky, tennis-playing, born-again Christian,'' plans to fleece his children of their inheritance by doing what he sees as a good deed -- investing their money in a new children's wing of the Oral Roberts University hospital. Such material is ripe for parody, and Chenoweth is at his best when he unmasks the hypocrisy behind the Goodpastures' rectitude, as in the story ''Reunions,'' when Brian Goodpasture, though angry at his father for abandoning him and his family, is momentarily enticed by the bawdy attractiveness of his father's new girlfriend. More often, unfortunately, Chenoweth's careful, studied prose feels pretentious, and his stories don't generate enough emotion to electrify a family drama. Instead of placing the reader in the thick of things, Chenoweth tends to set the action after the fact, as the characters look backward, assess the damage and take the first steps toward moving on. In ''The Visit,'' as the family convenes in Jacksonville, Fla., for the funeral of an uncle, Stuart Goodpasture Jr. recalls the details of accumulated family feuds, concluding, ''We were a tighter family than I had realized, but in relinquishing that inherited rage, I felt as though I could now accept what was left.'' For the Goodpastures, interpersonal strife is a relatively peaceful war of abruptly ended phone calls and dinner-table sniping. Such polite antagonism makes for rather lifeless fiction. Nora Krug\n",

      "Your article, ''Nassau Democrats Primed for Inroads, but Have Own Probems,'' [Feb. 28], neglected to mention that not too long ago the Nassau Democrats were able to successfully take advantage of Republican vulnerabilities. In 1961, Eugene Nickerson, a Democrat, defeated his Republican opponent for county executive. In this upset, the Democrats were able to capitalize on the fact that the Republicans nominated a weak candidate, were weakened by internal divisions, and were easily pictured as the party of ''boss rule'' in that the longtime party chairman, J. Russell Sprague, would be running the county government from behind the scenes. Mr. Nickerson, with his Ivy League background and lack of association with a powerful political organization, appealed to the better-than-average-educated voters moving into Nassau County. The lesson would seem that if the county Democrats could overcome their internal problems and nominate appealing candidates, they could again win county offices. JAMES SHELLAND Bellmore\n",

They had one child, and another, and another, and before long, their small house, with its spectacular view over the Texas hill country, suddenly seemed as crowded and uncomfortable as a box of Easter chicks. ''We kept on having children, and we desperately needed a bigger house, but we didn't want to give up the view,'' says Robin, who owns and operates a women's and children's clothing store in suburban Westlake. ''And we wanted a yard for the children. But everything either had the yard or the view, and we thought we'd have to give up one for the other. Our only option was to build, but where?'' The family grew, prospered -- Mark is the president of a telecommunications consulting company -- the closets filled, the rooms cluttered, and then a miracle happened. A piece of land became available right there in Westlake, also perched on a hillside and with a view just as magnificent. ''We snagged it,'' Robin says. That was 1994. For two years they planned the dream house they wanted to build on the site, all the things they had yearned for during the crowded years. A bedroom for everyone. A big kitchen with commercial-style appliances where Mark could cook to his heart's content. A three-car garage. Balconies and decks everywhere. A sprawling yard for the children. A pool. An exercise room so their workout equipment wasn't taking up a corner of the master bedroom. A media room with big-screen surround-sound high-tech everything. ''Our architect was amazing,'' Robin says. ''He would go out to the site, over and over again, to watch where the sun was setting so he could design the house with the windows and balconies perfectly positioned.''\n",

Such, at least, is the opinion of Vianne Rocher, one of the two narrators of Joanne Harris's accomplished novel, which opens with the arrival of Vianne and her young daughter in the small French town of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes at the beginning of Lent. When Vianne transforms a defunct bakery into a chocolate shop called La Celeste Praline, the story echoes those folk tales in which the Devil, disguised as an amiable stranger, seduces the upstanding citizens of a village by awakening their appetite for pleasure. But in ''Chocolat,'' Harris plays a variation on this theme, illuminating the awful things that can happen when we neglect the satisfactions of this world for the promise of a better one. Her amiable stranger stands on the side of earthly angels.\n",

What was more impressive is that Reid put on the virtuoso performance in just his 12th professional fight. There was some doubt as to whether the 25-year-old Reid (12-0) was ready to step up to the world championship level. But he proved more than the equal of Boudouani (38-3-1) with his slick skills. There were no knockdowns, though both fighters hurt each other. Boudouani has nothing to be embarrassed about. He fought like a champion and never quit, but Reid was just a little better.\n",

The place seems to be in a perpetual state of transformation, and the casino companies that built the amusement parks and Disneylike attractions in the early 1990's have now set their sights on more upscale tourists, building luxury hotels and casinos with couture shops and restaurants operated by world-renowned chefs. Redefining itself is what keeps Las Vegas fresh and keeps people returning -- especially with casino gambling available all around the country. From its gangster beginnings, to its martini-drenched Rat Pack age, its Elvis era, its Sin City days and its most recent family-friendly years, this other city that never sleeps also never stays the same. All along Las Vegas Boulevard, better known as the Strip, there is so much construction machinery reaching into the sky these days that locals now joke that the official state bird is the crane.\n",

      "BIG beat, a boisterous hybrid of hip-hop and house music, is currently the most popular dance style in Britain. The genre's leading artist, Fatboy Slim, just scored a No. 1 single in England with ''Praise You.'' And although big beat has yet to make a breakthrough on the American pop charts, you can already hear it in countless television commercials and movies like ''She's All That.'' Big beat works well in TV ads and Hollywood films because its is good-times music, plain and simple. It's also catchy, sampling hooks and riffs from early rap, disco, raunchy arena rock and 60's frat-party sounds like garage punk and surf music. Because of this nostalgic tinge, even big beat's fiercest supporters concede that the genre is not especially original, innovative or intelligent. Yet the music made by another big-beat band, Lo-Fidelity Allstars, which shares the same label with Fatboy Slim, Skint Records, exhibits all three of these attributes. The band's debut album, ''How to Operate With a Blown Mind'' (Columbia, CD, CK 69654), creates a harrowed and haunting atmosphere that is strikingly at odd's with big beat's cheery rumpus.

      "SIX months ago, Steven Spielberg's ''Saving Private Ryan,'' was virtually anointed by Hollywood as the winner of the Academy Award. How could the 5,500 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences vote against one of the most acclaimed films of Mr. Spielberg's career, a searing and patriotic drama about World War II soldiers, a movie that unexpectedly turned into a huge box office hit for its studios, Dreamworks and Paramount? Then along came the Weinstein brothers, Harvey and Bob. The co-chairmen of Miramax, the Disney-owned company, the Weinsteins have proved more successful than any company or studio in town at gathering Academy Award nominations. In every awards year since 1992, Miramax has been represented in the best picture category with such movies as ''Pulp Fiction,'' ''The Crying Game,'' and ''The English Patient,'' which won the prize in 1997.\n",

      "What is it with these people? Do they wake up one day and say, ''Let's move to that abandoned missile silo'' or ''Why don't we buy an old plane and turn it into a house''? What drives people to do something this, well, bizarre? Economics, surely, isn't the only reason. Unlike Diogenes, who lived in a tub, they don't appear to be ascetics. Maybe they want to be different, to be noticed; not just to own a conversation piece but to live in one. In fact, these are some of the same sentiments that motivate the clients of high-style architecture. After all, living in a caboose is no more odd than living in a house with all-glass walls or in a house perched over a waterfall, to name but two famous architectural landmarks. Of course, there is a difference between saying that ''a house is a machine for living in,'' as Le Corbusier did, and making a house out of a real machine. High-style architecture, especially modern high-style architecture, often thumbs its nose at comfort and convenience. It challenges its owners to do without. The challenge for aspiring caboose dwellers is different. Once they have made the plunge -- admittedly a high dive -- they usually work hard to transform their unfamiliar surroundings into something resembling a house. It is not easy to turn a missile silo or a Boeing 747 into a more or less cozy home. Where do you put the bathtub? How do you get in? What about closets? Like Robinson Crusoe, the builder makes do and improvises with whatever is at hand.\n",

      "The Times Of My Life And My Life With The Times. By Max Frankel. Illustrated. 546 pp. New York: Random House. $29.95. EXPERIENCED newspaper reporters arrive at middle age with a memory surrounded by a bodyguard of ironies. The reporter is always on the borders of someone else's country, his papers never quite in order. However much he knows, he can never know enough. The dispatch written with utter confidence turns out to be incomplete or wrongheaded. The dispatch written on instinct alone turns out to be God's truth. The best and most faithful of these characters come to understand that in some profound sense they are owned by their memories, and that in turn their own angle of vision -- in essence, whether they see themselves as insider or outsider, paleface or redskin -- depends on the earliest circumstances of their own lives, their childhood fears and joys, and on how danger was defined, and how it all fit in.

After-school programs for children in grades five though eight are the best strategy for offering safe, supervised environments, places where students can receive homework help and participate in recreational activities.

Simpson trial and perennial interest in conspiracy theories about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy are modern manifestations of this fascination, and anyone who thinks they will fade into the pages of history books might consider the fate of Lizzie Borden, still infamous as the ax murderer of her father and stepmother more than a century after she was acquitted of the 1892 double murder. Her story has been regularly revived as a subject for books, plays and television movies, as well as a ballet, Agnes de Mille's 1954 ''Fall River Legend,'' with music by Morton Gould. But if there's one art form in which murderous psychopaths really shine, it's opera; the surprising thing is that it wasn't until 1965 that this story made its operatic debut. That year the New York City Opera gave the premiere of Jack Beeson's ''Lizzie Borden,'' and on Saturday evening the company revisited it in a new staging, a co-production with the Glimmerglass Opera that was and first seen there in 1996.\n",

      "Public schools in New York State face a critical shortage of qualified teachers. It is estimated that New York City alone will need to hire 30,000 to 40,000 new teachers over the next five years. Other urban districts in the state face similar problems, though on a smaller scale. The shortage is caused by an aging teacher base and a move toward smaller classes just as the student population is increasing dramatically. Unfortunately, the need for more teachers could compromise an equally urgent need for higher academic standards for students. In July 1998, the New York State Board of Regents released a report titled ''Teaching to Higher Standards: New York's Commitment.'' The State Education Department is now writing the regulations to put that report's recommendations into action. But the solutions proposed by the Board of Regents, which will be the subject of public hearings this spring, would not fix the problem -- they would make things worse.\n",

The goal: tempt channel surfers to tune in whether or not there is a major continuing news story being covered. One network, MNC -- er, FNC, Fox News Channel -- has begun doing just that with a $4 million campaign centered on its prime-time programming.\n",

      "THE TOP-SEEDED TEAM Duke The Blue Devils (32-1, 16-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) are the third team since 1978 to win the regular-season title outright and the A.C.C. tournament. The other two were the Blue Devils of 1986 and 1992. SIX TEAMS WITH A SHOT EAST -- A physical Cincinnati team (26-5) hung Duke with its only loss. The Bearcats would have to beat the Miami Hurricanes (22-6) before they could face Duke. MIDWEST -- Michigan State (29-4) won its regular-season title and tournament, an accomplishment considering seven Big Ten teams are in the N.C.A.A.'s. Utah Coach Rick Majerus led the Utes (27-4) to the title game last year. SOUTH -- With a soft No. 1-seeded team in Auburn, St. John's (25-8) has a shot, and it took Duke to overtime on Jan. 24. WEST -- UConn (28-2) has never been to the Final Four, but is as skilled and as athletic as the Blue Devils. PLAYERS WHO CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE Mateen Cleaves, Michigan State Richard Hamilton, Connecticut Hamilton and Cleaves, above, lead No. 1-seeded teams. HAMILTON, a 6-6 junior guard will take Connecticut (28-2) to the West Regional. The Huskey offense pivots around the 42 percent shooter who averages 20.9 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists. CLEAVES, a 6-2 junior, and Michigan State (29-4) are in the Midwest Regional. The Spartans' offense begins with him and his 7 assists and 12 points a game. Chris Porter, Auburn The Auburn Tigers (27-3) are the South's No. 1-seeded team and are led by the Southeastern Conference player of the year Chris Porter. The 6-7 junior, playing his first season for Auburn after two years as a junior college all-American, averages 16.5 points and 8.8 rebounds and shoots 47 percent. Jason Terry, Arizona Andre Miller, Utah The two best guards in the nation hail from out west. Both are 6-2 seniors - one, Arizona's Terry, already owns a national championship ring from 1996-97. The other, Utah's Miller, played in the title game last year against Kentucky. TERRY The Wildcats (22-6) are seeded No. 4 in the Midwest, where Terry's 47-percent shooting, 22-point average, and 5.7 assists are certain to dazzle. MILLER The Utes (27.4 - including 22 victories in a row) are No. 2 in the Midwest. Miller is contending for player of the year honors because he makes 50 percent of his shots, and scores 16.1 a game, while pulling down 5.7 rebounds and handing out 5.8 assists. Wally Szczerbiak, Miami of Ohio The best player nobody has seen will finally find the spotlight when Szczerbiak and the RedHawks play the University of Washington in the Midwest Regional. The native of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., is a 6-8 forward who averaged 23.6 points and 8.7 rebounds to lead his team to a 20-6 record and No. 10 seeding. SENTIMENTAL STORIES Jim Phelan, Mount St. Mary's Phelan won his 800th game and earned his second trip to the N.C.A.A. tournament when the Mounties (15-14) beat Central Connecticut State in the Northeast Conference tournament champsionship game.

No. 801 will probably wait until next season - No. 16 Mount St. Mary's faces Michigan State. Samford The Bulldogs (24-5) won the Trans America Athletic Conference regular-season and tournament titles by taking Tiger Ball south to Alabama. The second-year Coach Jimmy Tillette is a student of the Princeton offense. The Bulldogs, who led the nation in 3-point shooting, will play St. John's on Thursday. Lafayette The Leopards (22-7) advanced to the tournament for the first time since 1957, ending the nation's second-longest drought behind that of Harvard (1946), by winning the Patriot League tournament. They face Miami. Steve Alford, Southwest Missouri St. Afford, last seen in the tournament as everyone's all-American at Indiana University, takes his Southwest Missouri Bearcats to Charlotte as the No. 12-seeded team in the East.

Cohen today offered Saudi Arabia new weapons and military training to help shore up its defenses against any threat from Baghdad. The offer came on what may be the most important stop in a nine-nation tour in which Mr. Cohen is seeking to solidify anti-Iraq sentiment among friendly Arab governments. Some Saudi officials are uncomfortable with the American air attacks on Iraq, and Mr. Cohen has said an important goal of his trip is to persuade Arab allies that the United States is ''acting appropriately.''\n",

Metaphorically, this is also where the Nets happen to be, about as far away from where they thought they were headed, their hopes for a turnaround in a season stuck on fast forward suddenly reduced to a wing and a prayer. From the corner, his back to the basket, Van Horn rotated on long, tired legs for a wild 3-point try that Larry Johnson, who is about four inches smaller, pinned back against his hands. A clean stuff, the final slur in another foul day in an increasingly obscene season for the Nets' franchise player.\n",

      "Mexico's center-right opposition party chalked up major election gains during the early 1990's but has lost momentum as a result of recent squabbles between the party's doctrinaire conservatives and its new, more pragmatic generation. Now that may change. Late Saturday, the party, National Action, elected a new party president, Senator Luis Felipe Bravo Mena. Analysts described him as a conciliator, with cordial ties to the party's old guard as well as excellent relations with the campaign of Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive from the party's younger wing who has been campaigning since last year for the party's presidential nomination. Mr. Bravo's credentials could help him attempt to unite the party behind Mr. Fox's candidacy, which would be an important development as the race takes shape for the presidential election in July 2000. Much of the infighting has centered on whether the party, known by its Spanish initials, PAN, should support Mr. Fox, the Governor of Guanajuato state, for the Presidency. But some of the party's leaders, including several descendants of the Roman Catholic politicians who founded the party in 1938, have been quietly undercutting Mr. Fox. ''Bravo is a bridging figure,'' said Federico Estevez, a political scientist. ''He's an intellectual who's close in temperament to the PAN's old guard, but who knows that his function must be to put the party at Fox's disposition.'' Mr. Bravo faced his first major political decision minutes after he was sworn in late Saturday at a party convention in a Mexico City hotel. Reporters pressed him for his position on recent proposals by several opposition politicians, including some old-guard leaders of his party, to support a common opposition candidate with the main leftist party to run next year against President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Mr. Bravo was noncommittal, saying only that he would organize a serious discussion within his party of these proposals, which have dominated politics here in recent days. In recent interviews, he has stressed the legal, ideological and practical obstacles to uniting the opposition behind a single candidate. Several analysts said the proposal for an opposition alliance appeared to be, at least in part, an attempt by Mr. Fox's rivals to undercut him. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Mexico City's leftist Mayor, another likely presidential candidate who is slumping in the polls, has endorsed the proposals and suggested that Mr. Fox should slow his campaign. And on Friday, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action's presidential candidate in 1994, who is perhaps Mr. Fox's greatest rival within the party, floated a new idea, urging opposition parties to unite around an alliance candidate with no ties to any of the major parties. Mr. Fox called Mr. Fernandez's proposal ''a joke,'' adding, ''Diego is in the habit of saying strange things to capture the media's attention.''\n",

      "After two months in office, House Speaker Dennis Hastert is on his way to making the very mistake that helped destroy Newt Gingrich. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support in the House for campaign finance reform, which could lead easily to its swift passage, Mr. Hastert has bottled up the legislation in committee until later in the year or next year. This is Gingrich-style obstructionism with a more genial face. Supporters of reform need to get ready for a renewed battle, including a petition drive to force the bill to the floor by spring. The fight started late last month, when Representatives Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts reintroduced their ''soft money'' ban. House rules prevent the start of collecting signatures for a petition until next month. But conservative pro-reform House Democrats, led by two Texans, Jim Turner and Charles Stenholm, have already informed Mr. Hastert that they will take the petition route if he does not yield. Some Republicans are already prepared to join them. Last year, Mr. Gingrich was humiliated by the success of a similar petition effort. The same fate awaits Mr. Hastert if he does not rise to this first test of his sincerity in wanting to change the atmosphere in the House.\n",

The partnership must have more combined points than it needs for game; and the scoring must be by imps, when the difference between scores of 430 and 450 is trivial. On this basis the North player on the diagramed deal should perhaps have bid three no-trump in response to one no-trump rather than search for a major-suit game by using Stayman.

The plan is more ambitious than anything the Corps has tried before.

I thanked her for the compliment, and she asked if she could have the bracelet when I die.

When I told her that I didn't, she smiled brightly and once again asked if she could have the bracelet when I die.

But while the prospect of competition was supposed to drive prices down, the opposite has happened.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 assumed the cable industry would be facing far more competition from satellite broadcasters and telephone companies. But that has not happened, raising deep concerns that cable companies unshackled from price controls and not threatened by competition will continue to impose big rate increases. [Page A1.]\n",

Mr. Thompson refused to help them. Reporters, he said in an interview last week, do not ask for other reporters' sources. In an editorial on his Web site -- a rant, in Webspeak -- he scoffed at the idea that he should ''trust the mainstream media that has either ignored the mounting evidence'' against President Clinton or ''rushed to his defense whenever legitimate stories were published about his many high crimes.''\n",

In the hours after Mr. Diallo's death last month, the family lawyers contend that police investigators ransacked his apartment and questioned his roommates about his character and possible enemies without telling them that it was the police who had shot their friend and kinsman. Police Commissioner Howard Safir, however, has vehemently denied that Bronx officers investigating the shooting had tricked Mr. Diallo's roommates or tried to smear his reputation as a way of explaining why the four white policemen shot him. Investigators were given permission to enter the apartment by roommates, he said. A supervisor specifically explained that it was the police who had shot Mr. Diallo, another police official said, and police made only a ''cursory'' search of Mr. Diallo's room to find identification for calling his next of kin. Those who went to the police station to talk about Mr. Diallo were not being held there but were free to go at any time, the Commissioner said.\n",

Ms. Takahashi, for whom Cage created scores, and Ms. Hong, whose admirers include Mr. Cunningham, would seem to be the perfect choices for the project. The inspiration of the Japan Society, which commissioned the new work, the collaboration was a powerful one that proved that less can be a great deal more. The score sounded more like Satie than Cage's celebrated later electronic coughs and gargles, with near-melody overlaying pounding rhythmic strokes. That same urgent play of light and dark informed the dance. For the most part the stage was dark. Light picked up the curve of Ms. Takahashi's cheek in profile and poured over the top of her piano so that they appeared to float in black space.\n",

It is also troubling to learn that the Clinton Administration did not react vigorously enough when it first heard of this possible breach of national security nearly four years ago. Some Administration officials suggest that the White House may have minimized the case to insulate its goal of improving relations with Beijing. Careless security procedures have been a longstanding problem at America's nuclear laboratories under Democratic and Republican administrations. But a report by The Times's James Risen and Jeff Gerth makes clear that after the 1995 discovery of possible espionage at Los Alamos the Administration moved too slowly to investigate and to weigh the implications of the case.\n",

The purpose of the right to sue is to serve as a deterrent against conduct by an H.M.O. that is in reckless disregard of a patient's needs. The Erisa (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) statute, enacted in the 1970's, keeps states from establishing causes of action and keeps patients from suing in state courts. But the statute also says a person can sue in Federal court. If the patient prevails, though, he can get only the service that was originally denied or its dollar value.\n",

He roamed the great open spaces there with a grace and grandeur that redefined the art of fielding. Even more than the prolific hitting that earned him enduring fame, his silky, seemingly effortless motion across the outfield grass was the signature of his game. DiMaggio was one of those rare sports stars, like Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, who not only set new standards of athletic excellence but also became a distinctive part of American culture. As stylish off the field as on, DiMaggio was an icon of elegance and success, a name as recognizable on Broadway and in Hollywood as at the ball park.

After the suspect left the room, detectives used the saliva he left on the cup to obtain his DNA. Testing then showed that his DNA matched not only the DNA found at that crime scene, but in the other four crimes as well, all of which occurred in East Harlem over a seven-year period.\n",

At the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Friday this preacher turned pop star led the Nu Nation -- a 12-piece choir, 5-piece band and dance troupe -- through an evening marked by the casual intimacy of daytime talk shows, the flash of pop hip-hop and the overheated feeling of smooth love songs. Aided by his co-star, the singer Cece Winans, he turned the evening into a giant group encounter. In between the Whitney Houston-style ballads the choir sang to Jesus, Mr. Franklin led his fans in reciting self-help affirmations and had them hold hands and hug, replicating the conciliatory moments on shows like ''Oprah.''\n",

The lyrics are a character study of a person in a specific place -- a spoiled, troubled child of Hollywood -- with a chorus, ''Everything's gonna be all right,'' that proffers a happy Hollywood movie ending. While the song starts by observing someone else, by the third verse it returns to the singer's perspective; empathy reverts to narcissism. But it's wrapped in tuneful, ingratiating folk-rock, with some modern-rock tricks -- a tape-loop drumbeat and a hint of grunge distortion to kick into the chorus -- that separate it from its folk-club kin.\n",

Likewise at my exam this year, my radiologist for the last eight years, Dr. Doreen Liebeskind, delivered the news that my X-rays looked fine. However, this time I feared something was the matter.\n",

      "TUCKER-Kenneth F., M.D. Prominent phychiatrist of Sutton Place South, New York City, died March 8, 1999 at New York Hospital. A long-time resident of Scarsdale, N.Y., Dr. Tucker had suffered from kidney failure and heart disease for many years. He was born September 5, 1927 in Brooklyn, N.Y. to Isaac and Belle Cooperstein Tucker, formerly of Russia. Dr. Tucker was an early graduate of Brooklyn Tech, attended R.P.I., and served with the U.S. Army in the Phillipines in 1946-1947. He received a B.S. in Chemistry from Columbia and graduated from Cornell Medical School in 1953. From that time until his death, Dr. Tucker conducted a private practice in psychiatry in the same office on Sutton Place. Long affilated with Payne Whitney, he was an early researcher in the use of chemicals to treat mental illness. During his distinguished career, he was a valued couselor to many prominent people and a source of wisdom, comfort and joy to all who had the good fortune to know him. Dr. Tucker was also a life-long sports fan; his first job, at fourteen, was selling programs at Ebbetts Field, for which he was paid $2 a day. At sixteen, he was a member of the New York All-City Championship Handball Team. In later years, he would often return to the handball courts at Coney Island to reminisce about his year of glory. Over his life time, he grew to forgive the New York Yankees for not having been situated in Brooklyn, and his emotional health rose and fell with the fortunes of his beloved New York Giants. Dr. Tucker was proud of his Jewish heritage and raised his children in his faith. Dr Tucker was also a reader of great acuity, breadth and curiosity; he triumphed weekly over the most difficult crosswords; his sense of humor was that of a true New Yorker. He married the late Barbara Irving in 1957. They had four children: Douglas Tucker, of Berkeley, CA., a forensic psychiatrist, Duane Tucker, of New York City, a database administrator, Holly Tucker, of Berkeley, CA., a research administrator and Randolph Tucker, a lawyer, of Ojai, CA. In 1991, Dr. Tucker married Amy Ellis Tucker, of Bronxville, N.Y., who survives him. He is also loved and survived by three grandchildren, Sam, Alan and Barbara Tucker of Ojai, CA., a sister Gertrude Tucker Weker, of Bethesda, MD. (his other sister, Evelyn Tucker Feinstein, pre-deceased him); a niece, Laurie Weker Lipton, of Rockville, MD. and four nephews, Richard Feinstein of Cranston, R.I., Lester Feinstein of Littleton, CO., Jonathan Weker of Mount Pelier, VT. and Robert Weker, of Winnewood, PA. Funeral service will be on March 10th at Congregation Kol Ami, 252 Soundview Ave, White Plains, N.Y. at 10AM. Contributions in Dr. Tucker's name may be made to the Cornell University Medical College, Department of Psychiatry.\n",

      "Ann Corio, the auburn-haired, green-eyed queen of burlesque whose long-running show, ''This Was Burlesque,'' kept alive the art of strippers and the comedy of baggy-pants clowns in the age of the X-rated film, died on March 1 at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. Ms. Corio, a resident of Cliffside Park, N.J., kept her age a closely guarded secret, but was believed to be in her 80's. A survivor of a shapely sisterhood that included Gypsy Rose Lee, Maggie Hart and Georgia Sothern, Ms. Corio lasted long enough to reach the iconic status that enabled her to present the striptease as a put-on.\n",

Mr. Ikenberg was pronounced dead at the scene.\n"

Or Magny-les-Villers, or Meloisey? Don't feel bad if you haven't; hardly anyone in this country has. At least not yet. They are little villages in the region known as the Hautes Cotes, an area the wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. has called the backwoods of Burgundy. If your idea of the backwoods is rundown farms and rusted cars, forget it; the Hautes Cotes (pronounced oat coat) is rural and quiet, but beautiful country. And it produces some attractive Burgundy wines.\n",

But then Ms. Davis, her face a pitiable blank, her eyes emptied of illusion, sets about setting you straight. Portraying Ruby McCollum, a black woman accused of shooting her white lover to death in a redneck Florida backwater in the early 1950's, Ms. Davis has the assignment of convincing the audience of the reasonable irrationality of her attraction to a man who stirs and brutalizes her, who arouses her with the mere sensation of his ''breath on my eyelids.'' Yet this affinity is for a man also capable of walking away from a violent encounter in her house ''smiling as if I'd won a contest and rape was the prize.''\n",

As a child, I always loved unsweetened lemonade, and now, when asked what might improve a dish, my response is frequently, ''Lemon!'' Both the juice and the zest give a fresh edge to food, adding a welcome acidity to some dishes, and a tart sweetness to others. The zest is not the entire rind or peel, but the thin outer yellow layer, with none of the underlying white pith attached. Zest is aptly named, as it has a complex flavor with a slight bitterness provided by the oils in the rind. Those who do not like this bitterness can reduce it a bit by blanching the zest for a minute or so and then running it under cold water.\n",

Mr. Icahn, the financier who has made not one but two attempts to shake up RJR Nabisco Holdings over the last four years, was strangely quiet yesterday despite recent threats of a proxy battle to force the company to split up its food and tobacco businesses. He had raised his stake in RJR Nabisco to 7.7 percent recently from 5.6 percent in late December. But traders suggested yesterday that he was in a selling mood and could have been part of the reason RJR Nabisco's stock dropped sharply from an intraday high of $31 to close at $28.75, up 12.5 cents. In recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Mr. Icahn disclosed that he and his affiliates had bought an additional 3.6 million shares for prices ranging from $25.94 to $27.87, increasing the total to 25 million shares.\n",

Twenty innocent tourists died last year in the Italian Alps when his low-flying Marine Corps jet severed the cable of their ski gondola in the Italian mountains. But the evidence presented at his court-martial showed that many others in the Marine Corps chain of command shared the blame. That gave the jury reason not to hold Captain Ashby criminally responsible. Captain Ashby and his crew were allowed to fly with unclear flight plans, out-of-date maps that did not show the cable line, faulty radar altimeters and poor communications with Air Force officers permanently assigned to the base at Aviano, Italy, where he and his crew were training. He may well have been flying his plane too low, too fast and in the wrong place. But the responsibility for those mistakes was not his alone.\n",

      "STRAX-Philip. A pioneer in the use of mammography and other screening techniques for the early detection of breast cancer died in his sleep on March 9, 1999. He was 90. Dr. Strax was the founder and director of the Guttman Institute in New York City and the Strax Institute in Fort Lauderdale, FL; both institutes were established as nonprofit centers for the early detection and prevention of breast cancer. In 1988, Dr. Strax received the Charles F. Kettering Prize from General Motors for his medical research which established the importance of early detection as a way to reduce death from breast cancer. He was also a published poet, an avid photographer, a 3-D movie creator, and a talented harmonica player. Dr. Strax survived his two wives, Bertha and Gertrude. Dr. Strax was loved by many, including his sister, Anne; six children, Norman, Rita, Polly, Marshall, Richard, and Gayle; eight grandchildren, Bonnie, Todd, Wayne, Jill, Daniel, Lauren, Adam, and Brandon; and one greatgrandson, Zachary, affectionately known as ''The Zak Man.'' Funeral services will be conducted at Temple Israel of Great Neck (108 Old Mill Road, 516-482-7800) on March 11, 1999 at 10:00 am. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Dr. Philip Strax Scholarship Fund, NYU School of Medicine, Office of Alumni Relations, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, would be appreciated. STRAX-Dr. Philip. We mourn the loss of our esteemed member and extend heartfelt condolences to his family. Temple Israel of Great Neck Sidney Freedman, President\n",

      "Verdi wrote ''I Masnadieri'' (''The Highwaymen''), to a libretto based on Schiller's play ''The Robbers,'' for London in 1847. Queen Victoria, who was there on opening night, recorded in her diary that she found the music ''commonplace,'' and history has tended to agree with her. This is, therefore, exactly the kind of work that Eve Queler's Opera Orchestra of New York exists to retrieve, and on Sunday night at Carnegie Hall the company produced a lusty performance. With its rollicking chorus of brigands, its ridiculously venomous villain (Francesco) and its melodramatic turns of events, the opera onstage might be hard to take seriously, but in a concert rendering one can forget the characters in favor of the singers. And since the cast on this occasion gave excellent value, the evening was thoroughly enjoyable. One of the opera's dramatic faults is its disappointing denouement. Carlo, the victim of his brother Francesco's gleeful plotting, has been living the outlaw life in the woods with his cheery companions, exiled from his family estates. Massimiliano, the rival siblings' father, also falls foul of foul Francesco and turns up in the same forest, where Carlo meets him but fails to disclose his identity.\n",

      "The adjectives that cluster around Stanley Kubrick and his work -- cool, distant, reclusive, savage, brilliant -- are words that measure discomfort. Moviegoers love nothing more than certainty, but Kubrick, who died Sunday at age 70, rarely gave them that consolation. Hollywood, which also loves certainty and is deeply distrustful of artistic independence, found Kubrick an unquantifiable sum, a man driven by perfectionism and the ideal of artistic control in an art form where collaboration, not to say compromise, is the rule. ''Paths of Glory,'' ''Lolita,'' ''Dr. Strangelove,'' ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ''A Clockwork Orange,'' ''The Shining,'' ''Full Metal Jacket'' -- these are movies governed by the passion of Kubrick's unflinching eye and by his implacable visual intelligence. That they are also sardonic and discomfiting goes without saying. ''Dr. Strangelove,'' which appeared in 1964, is an unforgettable send-up of the cold war, but it also embodies an ironic view of America that would characterize the counterculture of the late 1960's at its best. Yet by the time that counterculture reached its peak of dissent, 1968, Kubrick had released ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a film that transcends irony completely.\n",

      "Judith Fugate and Medhi Bahiri, once leading dancers in major ballet companies, have founded a nifty chamber ballet troupe called Dance Galaxy. It would be easy to see them as the dance world's Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney deciding suddenly ''to put on a show.'' But small touring troupes are part of a longtime ballet tradition, and careful thought was obviously behind Dance Galaxy in its official New York debut on Tuesday night. A mini-preview took place last fall when some of the company's women appeared in an excerpt at ''The Next Step,'' a benefit at the Kaye Playhouse. The opening of a run through Sunday at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea) was more promising, offering something more than light fare.\n"

Inmates were freed from appalling conditions behind institution walls only to reappear on city streets, wandering at risk to themselves and sometimes to others as well as to civic propriety. The community health alternatives that were supposed to replace the oversize state hospitals remained wishful thinking. Twenty-seven years ago, Geraldo Rivera was one of those who contributed to deinstitutionalism when he exposed Willowbrook, a New York home for the mentally retarded that came to stand for warehousing at its most excruciating.

Its sound, individually and as a group, is pure, lyrical and educated. Balance is good and clear, and the musicians' consistency in matters of tempo is remarkable. They all move on the same strong, supple band of time. A recent work by Jennifer Higdon, her ''Voices'' of 1993, gave them the chance to demonstrate these qualities and others. Its first movement, ''Blitz,'' had a lot to do with dissonant chords in angular rhythms. The music is by intention harsh, and its harshness came across, but the Pacifica made it also fluent and beautiful. In the later movements, ''Soft Enlacing'' and ''Grace,'' dynamism gives way to gestures of harmonics answering each other, and again the Pacifica's exactness was a help.\n",

      "The Monica Lewinsky jokes worked. Last week, after Ms. Lewinsky's astronomically high-rated ABC interview with Barbara Walters, Jon Stewart reported on ''The Daily Show'': ''Lewinsky said her liaison with Clinton was 'the most amazing experience of my life,' a description she had only previously given to reading 'Flowers in the Attic,' seeing 'Phantom' on stage in Baltimore and helping special-ed kids pull taffy at high school.'' ''The Daily Show,'' Comedy Central's three-year-old half-hour parody of a news broadcast, has always straddled the fence between adolescent humor and grown-up wit.

New cases of prostate cancer have risen dramatically in recent years with the widespread use of a test to detect prostate-specific antigen. The test, first introduced in 1985, is recommended annually for men over 50 and measures the level of this substance in the blood and may indicate the presence of a cancer. Controversy has swirled around the use of the prostate-specific antigen test because in some men prostate cancer is not an aggressive disease and would never become a clinical problem before they die. But in many others the test has proved to be a lifesaver that picked up potentially deadly cancers before they caused symptoms and while they could still be cured.\n",

And these two roles could not be more different. Rigoletto is a touchstone of the Verdi baritone repertory, for which vibrant sound and arching legato phrasing are requisites. Wozzeck, with its roots in German Expressionism, is a landmark of the early 20th century, a role whose dramatic demands are, if anything, more significant than its vocal ones. For a Met newcomer to succeed in both roles within roughly a month would be a real one-two-punch knockout.\n",

That is the practical meaning of District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter's ruling on Monday that the N.C.A.A.'s system of basing eligibility largely on standardized test scores is unfair to blacks. The ruling does not mean that colleges should abandon their worthwhile and necessary efforts to improve graduation rates among athletes. It does mean finding fairer ways to measure academic potential. At issue in the case, brought by four black student athletes who were ruled ineligible to play sports in their freshman year because of low admissions scores, was a rule known as Proposition 16. Instituted by the N.C.A.A. in 1996, Proposition 16 tried to address well-documented charges that the aggressive competition to enroll athletic talent had created a universe of students who were badly prepared for academic life and stood little chance of graduating.\n",

      "The battle over the nation's scarcest medical resource, human organs, has moved from Washington to the states, where a number of legislatures have begun passing laws that would bar donated hearts, lungs, kidneys, livers and pancreases from being shipped beyond their borders to sick people elsewhere in the country. So far, the laws have not had a large effect on the way organs are distributed. Rather, they are intended to thwart an effort by the Clinton Administration to force organ recovery networks and transplant centers around the nation to share their precious organs more liberally. ''They changed the rule, so I introduced legislation,'' Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''In this state, we go out and aggressively encourage people to be donors, with me doing public service announcements. If I'm going to do that, I want those organs to stay in the state and take care of the patients that need it in Wisconsin.'' Four other states -- Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Florida -- have adopted laws similar to Wisconsin's. In Arizona, lawmakers in both houses have approved similar bills, but they include differences that must be ironed out. Legislation has been introduced in Texas. More than 61,000 Americans are now waiting for organ transplants, but only about 20,000 transplants are performed each year because the demand for organs far outweighs the supply. Under the current system for sharing organs, the nation is divided into 63 areas comprising 11 regions, and there are huge disparities in waiting times from area to area and region to region. For instance, for patients with blood type O, who represent 47 percent of the nation's liver transplant candidates, the median waiting time in New York City is 511 days while the median time in northern New Jersey is only 56 days. Last spring, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, announced her intention to even out those waiting times by giving organs to the most sick patients first, regardless of where they lived. Dr. Shalala said the current system ''put geography ahead of medical need.'' But the plan, issued in the form of a Federal regulation, engendered such a bitter fight among transplant doctors, hospitals and patients that Congress delayed its effective date until Oct. 1. The debate will come to the fore in Washington on Thursday when the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, starts its own examination of the organ allocation system. The review is being conducted at the request of Congress; the institute has appointed a panel of 16 experts, including surgeons, ethicists, epidemiologists and a health care economist to carry out the study. ''We need an objective reviewer,'' said Louise Jacobbi, executive director of the Louisiana Organ Procurement Agency in Metairie, La. In 1997, Ms. Jacobbi, aware that the Federal Government was about to change its rules, was instrumental in persuading her state to become the first to enact a law putting its own residents first. That law has become a model for the other states. ''Fundamentally, we have been rationing organs since the beginning of transplantation,'' she said. ''We have always had fewer organs than we have had patients. If we are going to change the way we practice medicine, it needs to be based on good medical data.'' The institute, which hopes to finish its study by September, will present its findings to Congress, which may decide to step in and overhaul the allocation system on its own. But if Congress does not act, the entire issue could wind up in court, with Wisconsin and the other states suing the Federal Government in a state's rights dispute over which provision -- the Clinton Administration's rule or state laws -- takes precedence. Dr. Claude Earl Fox, administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the organ allocation system, said in an interview that the new regulation superseded state law. But in a suit filed in Louisiana last spring, the Louisiana Attorney General contended the opposite, saying that only an act of Congress, and not a bureaucratic regulation, could override a state law. That suit is being held in abeyance while the Federal rule is on hold. But should the Administration's plan go into effect, Governor Thompson said Wisconsin would probably also sue. ''This rule is unconstitutional,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''It pre-empts state's rights.'' The current organ donation system is 15 years old; it flows out of a 1984 law called the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Act, which gives the Department of Health and Human Services authority to regulate the national organ distribution system. The law prohibited the buying and selling of organs and declared them a national resource. As it stands, the system works this way: A private, nonprofit organization, the United Network for Organ Sharing, contracts with the health and human services agency to distribute donated organs. The network has divided the country into 11 regions. Within those regions, there are 63 local organ procurement organizations, whose job it is to obtain and distribute organs. Under the current rules, organs are offered first within the local area, then regionwide, then nationally. But the system is incredibly Balkanized; Dallas and Fort Worth, for instance, share an airport and are only 30 miles apart, yet they belong to different organ procurement organizations and do not share organs. If there are extra livers or kidneys in Fort Worth, they are offered to patients in Houston, four hours away. ''It's a tragedy,'' said Dr. Goran B. Klintmalm, chief of transplant surgery at the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. This is his solution: Baylor is about to set up a satellite transplant center in Fort Worth, so that its Dallas patients will be eligible for organs that otherwise would have gone to Houston. ''We don't want to duplicate services,'' Dr. Klintmalm said, ''but it's the only way we can make organs stay in the metroplex.'' The Clinton Administration's rule ordered the organ-sharing network to come up with a new system that would distribute organs more broadly. The Administration said that if network officials did not change the system on their own, the Department of Health of Human Services would change it for them. But the network, which is composed mostly of representatives from the smaller transplant centers, said its members preferred the current system. In the wake of Dr. Shalala's announcement of the new rule, doctors at some of the centers, along with officials of the local organ procurement organizations, began pressing their state legislators to pass laws that would keep organs within state boundaries. Most of the laws include provisions stating that states can share organs, so long as they have reciprocal arrangements with other states. Even so, they have been criticized as provincial. ''Oklahoma has been castigated,'' complained Robert Turner, executive director of the Oklahoma Organ Sharing Network. ''We have been called narrow-minded, self-centered, not caring for others. Actually, our law is pretty moderate. It says that we can't bypass local patients unless we get a payback for the organ.'' In Ohio, the Legislature stopped short of passing a law, but adopted a resolution that urged Dr. Shalala to give greater weight to the views of transplant centers. A transplant surgeon at one center, Dr. Douglas Hanto of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said of the Federal plan: ''If this rule goes through, you will see more and more states passing laws. And it will be a huge controversy. I don't think that Donna Shalala or Bill Clinton really understands the degree of opposition to this rule.'' Federal officials, however, say the state laws are misguided. ''We know that, on average, about a third of all organ recipients go outside their state of residence to get a transplant,'' Dr. Fox said. ''We have a lot of sharing that is going on across state lines. States, in my opinion, could be shooting themselves in the foot by passing language that restricts that.'' Underlying the dispute is an economic turf war between transplant centers, which are competing for their share of the transplant business, in which an operation can cost $250,000 or more. On one side are large hospitals, which tend to have long waiting lists of patients who tend to be sicker; they would presumably benefit from the new rule by receiving additional organs now being used elsewhere. On the other side are small transplant centers, which fear Dr. Shalala's plan could put them out of business by stripping them of their supply of organs. ''It's a mess,'' said Dr. John J. Fung, who directs the transplant program at the University of Pittsburgh, one of the largest in the nation, and is a staunch advocate of increased sharing. ''Everybody is hunkering down and protecting their own turf. It's only going to get nastier, and the sooner we get it resolved the sooner the healing process will begin. All we are doing now is making the wounds bigger and bigger.''\n",

The process shows up most clearly in dance music, where disk jockeys and producers ransack the vinyl archives to find the most effective grooves. So it was pretty funny when Sugar B, the inane M.C. working with the Austrian team of Kruder and Dorfmeister, proclaimed, ''Originality guaranteed!'' from the stage at Irving Plaza on Tuesday night. The music had been assembled from other people's recordings. Peter Kruder and Richard Dorfmeister, who work together as disk jockeys, remixers and producers, played a four-hour set for an overflowing crowd. And on Monday night the Lo Fidelity Allstars sold out the Bowery Ballroom, meshing canned grooves with a live band.\n",

It is ''Why You Lose at Bridge'' by S. J. Simon, and his shrewd commentary on the weaknesses of the average player, spiced with considerable humor, is still read with pleasure and profit. In it he demonstrated forcefully the unwisdom of doubling slams simply because you have two aces, or because you think you have enough values to inconvenience the declarer. It is not only that the mathematics are heavily against the doubler: he is risking a large loss for a small profit. There is also the considerable danger that the double will help the declarer make a contract that would otherwise have failed or help him reduce the penalty.\n",

St. John's (25-8), seeded third in the South Regional and opening Thursday night against Samford, is playing smarter, tougher basketball than it did last season despite the loss of its two leading scorers, and the addition of a freshman point guard, a new coach and a new offensive style. It appears unlikely that a team like Samford -- smaller, slower and less talented than St. John's -- could pull off the upset as Detroit did in the first round last year. But for all its improvement in personnel, St. John's is still weak enough in several critical areas -- depth, free-throw shooting and execution of a halfcourt offense -- that leaves it vulnerable to an early exit any time after the first round.\n",

The museum held a groundbreaking ceremony on Monday for the renovation of its 70,000-square-foot brick building, constructed in 1909 as an opera house with dirt floors. ''During the day, there were cattle auctions, and at night, they'd bring in the chairs and have opera,'' said Wendy Evans Joseph, a Manhattan architect who is designing the interior of the museum. When the Women's Museum opens, all that will remain of the old building is its shell and its Art Deco facade (added during a renovation in 1936). Visitors will enter an airy lobby, above left, with an electronic quilt made of 16 video monitors. ''The quilt will be a patchwork of imagery taken from video exhibitions in the museum,'' said Terren Baker, who is designing the exhibitions with David Lackey of Whirlwind and Company in Manhattan.

She is an enduring and essential reminder of the emotional vitality of the American musical, and when such a rare natural resource is squandered, it's hard not to get angry. The abuse of Ms. Peters in this disdainful, revisionist take on Irving Berlin's most famous musical is definitely cause for fuming.

      "It's easy to see why ''The Deep End of the Ocean'' became Oprah Winfrey's first book club selection, the first book she thought America might read en masse. Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel about a family thrown into turmoil tells a page-turner of a story that hits a universal nerve. All Beth Cappadora need do is get caught up in the hubbub of a high school reunion and take her eyes off her 3-year-old for a couple of minutes. That's all it takes to explode Beth's picture-perfect Middle American family life. The boy is gone, perhaps forever, and all bets are off. Ms. Mitchard sent Beth into a somewhat wilder, angrier downhill spiral than the glossy film adaptation of ''The Deep End of the Ocean'' chooses to. But like Ulu Grosbard's previous film, ''Georgia,'' this one summons the kind of family friction that creates sparks. With a fine, impassioned performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the story's raw-nerved heroine, the film moves beyond the detective-story aspects of its material to concentrate on what kind of shock waves batter a family after an event like this. The aftereffects are keenly observed, and you needn't read further if you'd like to be surprised by the plot twist behind 3-year-old Ben's disappearance. It's startling, and I'm glad I didn't know about it going in.\n",

Now Mary McDonnell does the same in ''Replacing Dad,'' a CBS movie that rises above the brave-woman-with-troubles genre. The Marshes are just beaming with love in the early scenes. Linda (Ms. McDonnell) laughs as things tumble out of a closet at the family's idyllic beach house. Life is wacky but wonderful. She rushes to the school auditorium and stares adoringly at her husband, George (William Russ), the principal, at the podium. Their elder son, Drew (Eric von Detten), is blond, gorgeous and just rebellious enough to prove he's normal. Their daughter, Mandy (Camilla Belle), is adorable but spunky. And their 4-year-old, Willie (Hayden Tank), is appropriately precious.\n",

      "''Wing Commander'' is based on a video game and has roughly the same degree of character development. That is all most moviegoers will need to know. For others, here is the so-called plot: In the year 2564 Earth is at war with the Kilrathi, who appear to be murky dark green monsters. (Or is it the lighting on their spaceships?) Two scrappy young soldiers -- Christopher Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Todd Marshall (Matthew Lillard), nicknamed Maniac -- have to deliver an encoded disk with a message about an invasion. Afterward they meet two fabulous women: Deveraux (Saffron Burrows), nicknamed Angel, their stoic wing commander, and Rosie (Ginny Holden), another fighter pilot. It's good to see that they've got that women-in-combat thing worked out in the 26th century.\n",

Despite the physical limitations of quadriplegia and part time dependency on a respirator because of polio contracted in 1955, Lennie lived a life full of the realization of his goals and visions. His 26-year career at Sears Roebuck was marked by achievements in the early years of data processing and systems development. In 1980, he and his wife Marie opened Images Art Gallery in Briarcliff Manor. Both at Sears and at Images, he was mentor and friend to so many whose lives were touched by the quiet grace, dignity and incredible sense of humor with which he lived. He died just one day after his childhood hero, Joe DiMaggio, and the words which described the elegance of the athlete could well apply to Lennie. He will live on in the hearts of all whose lives he touched, but mainly in his wife Marie Pantuosco Alpert who has never known where she began and he ended and in his nephew Larry Friedman, his niece Ellen Friedman, their spouses Holly Holmes and Jeff Cowan; great nieces Rachel, Celia and Molly; great nephew Sam and sister and brother-in-law Blanche and Jack Friedman. A memorial service is planned for a later date. ALPERT-Leonard B. A wonderful friend and a loyal America. Lenny was brilliant, sensitive, courageous, perceptive and irrepressibly optimistic.

When Danny asks for a peach, Chen insists he choose a plum instead and quotes from a Sinatra song: ''Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum.'' Later in the film, a fragment of that Sinatra song, ''The Best Is Yet to Come,'' rises on the soundtrack at a particularly dramatic moment and lends the scene, set in the bowels of a grim freighter packed with illegal Chinese aliens, an eerie poignancy. Little touches like these lend ''The Corruptor'' a stylish patina that puts it a cut above much of the competition. The movie may be a conventional story of police corruption, temptation and conflicting loyalties, but it never loses its smarts.\n",

Pat Kingsley, a top public relations executive who represents some high-profile movie stars, saw the movie last Friday afternoon at Mr. Kubrick's home in Hertfordshire, outside London. Mr. Kubrick was not at the screening but upstairs in his bedroom because he said he was coming down with the flu. But after Ms. Kingsley saw the film, she spent about 45 minutes talking to Mr. Kubrick by telephone. By Sunday morning the 70-year-old director of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''Dr. Strangelove'' had died in his sleep. Among those scheduled to attend his funeral in England on Friday are the film's two stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (above), as well as Steven Spielberg and other filmmakers. On Wednesday a 90-second clip from the film was shown to thousands of theater exhibitors at the Showest convention in Las Vegas, Nev. The eye-opening excerpts included an explicit nude scene of Ms. Kidman (who also shed her clothes in ''The Blue Room'' on Broadway) and a passionate interlude between her and Mr. Cruise.\n",

Of course, it's also the word adults use to describe adolescent behavior that they condemn but would rather not discuss. It is this meaning that a group of high school students has turned on its head in a musical titled, appropriately, ''Inappropriate.'' Lonnie McNeil, the theater director at the DeSisto School in Stockbridge, Mass., has adapted the play's vignettes and monologues from the past work of DeSisto students, who often come to the school by way of broken homes, drug rehabilitation and brushes with the law. An alternative boarding school for troubled adolescents, it is not the kind of place you expect to find singing and dancing.

The Great Rebellion, also known as the Indian Mutiny, ensued; British firepower won; the company failed, and what was the Crown to do but step in? Victoria was fascinated by the jewel in her crown, and so were her subjects. She hired Indian servants, one of whom became quite influential.

Why has an industry with the potential to enrich our lives sunk into a soul-deadening wasteland of cartoonish violence and adolescent pranks? The answer, of course, has something to do with commercial calculation and least-common-denominator marketing. That leaves the questions: Where can you go to find a cinematic semblance of flesh-and-blood people with complicated emotions and bodies that perspire, instead of pose, when they make love? Where can you find movies with characters who think as well as act, movies that capture a recognizable sense of life's texture, the feeling of here and now? Heaven knows America's independent films are trying to fill the gap, and some are succeeding.\n"

The median wait for patients with blood type O for a liver transplant in New York City, for example, is 511 days, while the wait a few miles away in New Jersey is 56 days. These irrational differences arise from a system that often requires that organs be used in the area where they are donated even though they might be more urgently needed elsewhere. Congress has blocked an order from the Health and Human Services Secretary, Donna Shalala, that might have produced reform. Last year Ms. Shalala directed the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private organization that distributes donated organs, to devise a new allocation strategy.

These images, in combinations of gouache, colored pencil and felt-tip pen, feature floating figures, attentive animals, elaborate houses, occasional historical figures and political commentary and an impeccable sense of composition. They pull together the strands of Rowe's life and times, her faith and her fantasies and dreams to create one of the most formally fluid, spatially inventive and elaborately symbolic styles in outsider art.

''All Too Human,'' the awkward title of the new memoir by President Clinton's former adviser, George Stephanopoulos, seems meant as a commentary on the author's famously flawed former boss and on the author himself. The book depicts Mr. Clinton as a man of contradictions, a politician whose very ''shamelessness is a key to his political success,'' a man whose ''capacity for denial is tied to the optimism that is his greatest political strength.'' At the same time, it creates a sort of Bildungsroman portrait of the author as a young man whose idealism is tempered by ''raw ambition,'' a onetime altar boy turned political operative, whose messianic fervor on behalf on the candidate he helped get elected gradually gives way to disillusion and doubt.\n",

INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF CABARET, Oak Room, the Algonquin, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. Michel Hermon, Nando Gabrieli and Michael Amante, the three singers who are appearing on a rotating schedule at the Oak Room, are all pop traditionalists whose repertory is predominantly non-English. Mr. Hermon, a Parisian interpreter of Edith Piaf songs and the best of the three, is a powerful theatrical interpreter who emotes with a mimelike intensity and precision. Mr. Gabrieli, a young, long-haired Brazilian who mixes pop sambas with Sinatra standards, has an appealingly husky voice but limited technique and severe pitch problems. Mr. Amante, a charismatic Italian-American tenor, aspires to fill the shoes of Sergio Franchi in the growing opera-pop crossover market. His set includes the inevitable ''Nessun dorma'' sung to a taped orchestral accompaniment. Through Sunday. Tonight: Mr. Hermon at 9; Mr. Gabrieli at 11:30. Tomorrow night: Mr. Amante at 9; Mr. Hermon at 11:30. Sunday night: Mr. Gabrieli at 6:30. Seatings for dinner begin 90 minutes before the 6:30 and 9 P.M. performances.

      "True North Communications in Chicago said yesterday that David Bell, the president and chief executive of its Bozell Worldwide unit in New York, would become chairman and chief executive of True North on March 31 when Bruce Mason, the current chief executive, is scheduled to retire. The selection of Mr. Bell, 55, ends a yearlong search for a successor to Mr. Mason both inside and outside True North, the world's sixth-largest agency company, with estimated billings of $12 billion from clients like Bristol-Myers Squibb, DaimlerChrysler and S. C. Johnson. True North was embarrassed when Adweek published a report last month that had been prepared by Heidrick & Struggles, the executive search firm seeking a successor to Mr. Mason, which frankly addressed challenges faced by True North in competing against larger rivals.\n",

      "The business and political establishment of Salt Lake City has portrayed the bribe-giving involved in securing the Winter Olympic Games for 2002 as largely the handiwork of two rogue executives. Both of them, along with several board members, have resigned. Virtually everyone else involved in Salt Lake City's bid efforts was supposedly unaware. But documents obtained and interviews conducted by Times reporters strongly suggest otherwise. Paperwork from the accounting firm of Ernst & Young indicates that senior bid committee officials, including top officials of Utah corporations, were briefed in 1995 about questionable payments. That is an assertion these business leaders deny. Disturbingly, documents that might resolve the dispute -- namely, minutes and handwritten notes taken during bid committee meetings in 1994 and 1995 -- were destroyed by the committee's law firm. The law firm, in turn, says it does not know who gave the order to shred or dispose of the documents.\n",

      "Bulworth Senator Jay Bulworth (Warren Beatty, left) is so tired of campaigning and life in general that he hires a hit man to kill him for his life insurance. Then it occurs to him that he is free to do the utterly unthinkable for a politician up for re-election: tell the truth. Soon he is regaling black audiences to beware of lying white liberals like him. It's a different approach all right, but Bulworth stays loose, attracts a young black woman (Halle Berry) and turns himself into a white rapping homeboy. And that, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, suits a political satire with ''jubilant wit and energy.'' 1998. Fox. $104.16. 106 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: March 16. One True Thing When Kate Gulden (Meryl Streep) develops terminal cancer, her daughter Ellen (Renee Zellweger) puts her career on hold and goes home to care for her. As the illness progresses, the younger woman struggles with caring for a parent who is reluctant to surrender control. Fortunately for them, the ordeal takes place in a spacious dream house of the kind invariably used in films that add plenty of cushioning to their tough situations. All the right emotions get used -- anger, grief, helplessness and frustration -- but as awful as the situation is, one is always aware that the movie ''shrewdly blurs the line between tear-drenched suds and serious drama'' (Stephen Holden). 1998. Universal. $107.37. 128 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: March 16. The Waterboy Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) is an extremely simple Louisiana bayou boy of 31 who talks as if he had an infected molar in need of immediate extraction and lives to pass out water to the louts on the local college football team. Ridiculed for his efforts, Bobby is finally terminated from his post and sent home to mama (Kathy Bates). But Bobby craves water (or serving it) and lands with another team whose coach (Henry Winkler) unleashes his anger and turns him into a star linebacker. That's probably dumb enough, but ''this escapist comedy is so cheerfully outlandish that it's hard to resist'' (Maslin). 1998. Touchstone. $108.67. 88 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: March 16. Polish Wedding Jam a stunning and lusty Polish-American cleaning woman named Jadzia (Lena Olin), her husband (Gabriel Byrne), their four sons and daughter, their daughter-in-law and a grandchild into a crowded house on the outskirts of Detroit, and you have what might have been one of those funny, earthy working-class films that Hollywood has unsuccessfully been trying to make ever since ''Moonstruck.'' But in this case an emphasis on heartwarming nostalgia drains much of the humor from ''an aggressively sentimental, nearly laugh-free comedy'' (Holden). 1998. Fox. $100.96. 107 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: March 16. Straight to Video Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions. THE WONDERFUL ICE CREAM SUIT. As a youth, the writer Ray Bradbury spent time among Mexicans who often bought clothes together and shared them. In this Bradbury tale, five friends from the Boyle Heights district in East Los Angeles buy an enchanted white suit that each of them will wear for an evening and use to realize his dreams. The story first appeared in The Saturday Evening Post in 1957. It became a play in 1973 and now is a straight-to-video film that stars Edward James Olmos and Joe Mantegna and is directed by Stuart Gordon. 1999. Touchstone. $104.16. 77 minutes. Closed captioned.

      "With the swing revival in full force and the events of the Ellington centennial all around, it's a good moment to consider some of the swing era's side streams. The music of the John Kirby Sextet is a perfect example. Wayne Roberts, a bass player and band leader, has been working for four years on transcribing the sextet's music from the 1930's and 40's, and he has found a perfect place to show what he has learned. The Firebird Cafe, on Restaurant Row at 365 West 46th Street, Clinton, has booked him every Monday night for the last several months; its back-room cabaret, with an audience space that wraps around the bandstand, is as cozy as a living room. It's the best way to hear the Kirby repertory, which is such a low-impact and primly amusing form of jazz that having your head right in the middle of it helps greatly in appreciating its charms. (A bass player and band leader, Kirby wasn't the composer or arranger of most of these shrewd, eventful miniatures; his gifted trumpet player, Charlie Shavers, did a lot of that, as well as some other writers.) The music, which the Kirby group started playing during an 11-month residency at 52d Street's old Onyx Club, was made for light entertainment, and for an audience beyond jazz fans; it had little improvisation and few intricate arrangements, and a good deal of it glossed on the best-known classical hits.\n",

The action was taken pending the outcome of an inquiry into allegations that from 1993 to 1998, a former office manager in the university's academic counseling unit did course work for at least 20 players in the basketball program, including four on the current team.\n",

''We have a failed social policy and it has to be re-evaluated,'' says Barry R. McCaffrey, the four-star general in charge of national drug control policy. The boomerang effect of the failed policy was richly detailed in recent articles by Timothy Egan of The Times. School systems deteriorate while tax dollars build new prisons. Municipal police forces have grown so militarized that drug warrants are served in armored personnel carriers. Young mothers are imprisoned for years for simple drug possession. Young black males in California are now five times as likely to go to prison as to a state university.\n",

This balancing act is reflected in the issues that the House Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, has identified as the four pillars of Republican policy in the 106th Congress: Social Security, tax relief, education and national defense. In two of these areas, Republicans admit they are playing defense; Democrats have long had the public's trust on education and Social Security.

      "There is something endearing about the contradictions embodied in the lute. Its voice is small and personal, and listeners used to hearing it on recordings cranked up to at least harpsichord volume are surprised at its delicacy when they encounter it in the concert hall. Yet it has a body of virtuosic literature that can both dazzle and move listeners. In terms of sheer physical layout, it is an inefficient instrument for counterpoint, which demands an independence of line difficult to achieve when two fingers are required to play each note (one to stop the string on the fretboard, one to pluck it). Its most enduring repertory, though, is manifestly and demandingly contrapuntal. In Darwinian terms, the lute was supplanted by the keyboard two centuries ago, but since the 1920's a small army of devoted lutenists has kept its flame alive. As it turned out, lutenists were ahead of their time: although the lute has been drafted into the period-instruments movement, its revival began as part of a broader fascination with the guitar and its roots, long before there was any real interest in archaic forms of orchestral instruments.\n",

The House of Representatives voted on Thursday to support sending American peacekeeping troops to enforce a settlement in Kosovo, removing any doubt about American participation. Yesterday the commanders of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas wisely agreed to accept the peace plan proposed by Washington, its European allies and Russia. The ethnic Albanians are expected to sign the deal this weekend. If they do, Mr. Milosevic's refusal to allow international peacekeepers into Kosovo will be the only remaining obstacle. It is crucial that the countries supervising the peace talks remain united, and that NATO sustain its resolve to use force, if necessary, to get Mr. Milosevic to sign a deal. The ethnic Albanians were initially expected to embrace the agreement, which may prevent the death of thousands of civilians. But they left France with the promise only that they would sign after two weeks of conferring in Kosovo. They are now apparently prepared to do so, thus allowing NATO to unite on the threat of force against Mr. Milosevic.\n",

He died just one day after his childhood hero, Joe DiMaggio, and the words which described the elegance of the athlete could well apply to Lennie. He will live on in the hearts of all whose lives he touched, but mainly in his wife Marie Pantuosco Alpert who has never known where she began and he ended and in his nephew Larry Friedman, his niece Ellen Friedman, their spouses Holly Holmes and Jeff Cowan; great nieces Rachel, Celia and Molly; great nephew Sam and sister and brother-in-law Blanche and Jack Friedman. A memorial service is planned for a later date.\n"

      "SAYAO-Bidu. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of one of our greatest and most beloved artists, soprano Bidu Sayao. Her debut here in 1937 in the title role of Massenet's ''Manon'' began a love affair with the New York public which was enchanted by this small, beautiful woman with an unusually sweet voice and elegant stage demeanor. She went on to sing 236 performances of twelve roles with the Met. Her most frequent roles were her touching Mimi in Puccini's ''La Boheme,'' and her graceful Susanna in Mozart's ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' Her ability to incarnate youthful, fragile and vulnerable characters while singing with a consistently beautiful tone and great musicality was unique. As charming offstage as she was on-stage, Ms. Sayao was held in the highest esteem by her colleagues and friends in the opera house. She continued to be a strong supporter of the Met after her retirement, and in 1983 became a Member of the Metropolitan Opera Association, a position she held until her death. We offer our sincere condolences to her family and to her many devoted friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director SAYAO-Bidu. The Richard Tucker Music Foundation is deeply sadden by the passing of this legendary Brazilian soprano and member of the Foundation's Board of Artists. She graced the stage of the Metropolitan Opera for 16 seasons, leaving an indelible memory of supreme vocal and dramatic artistry and she was also a wonderful concert and recital singer. We are fortunate that her recording of ''La Boheme'', recorded with Richard Tucker at the old Met, is a living reminder of her supreme and unique qualities, of which the greatest was her charm.\n",

      "Lois-Ann Yamanaka concludes her trilogy of novels set among the Japanese-American working class in Hilo, Hawaii, with a work that delivers a precise look at this vibrant culture yet still speaks to anyone who has experienced the joy, security and small humiliations of family life. While it lacks the exuberant tang of ''Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers'' and the wrenching pathos of ''Blu's Hanging,'' her first two novels, HEADS BY HARRY (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24) makes up for that with its own subtle charms. Again the story focuses on a young woman's coming of age ait's about how she learns to balance the sometimes conflicting obligations to family and self. The novel's spirited heroine, Toni Yagyuu, resists her parents' plans for her to go to college and escape the limitations of life in Hilo; instead, she wants to learn the art of taxidermy from her father, Harry O. (The novel is chock-full of animals, living, stuffed and at every stage between.) Toni must also contend with an occasionally adversarial tag team made up of her brother, Sheldon, whose unspoken but obvious homosexuality infuriates her father, and her more beautiful and popular sister, Bunny. On her side, usually, are Maverick, the town hunk, and Wyatt, his angry brother. Toni stumbles from disappointment to failure to heartbreak, all the while trying to convince her hardheaded but not hardhearted father that home is where she belongs. Yamanaka ends the novel, as she did her first two, with a long list of thank-yous. In doing so, she hints at the deep bonds of community and family that inspire her raw, rich stories.

These are the basic questions raised by the Canadian Center for Architecture's competition to redesign an important piece of land on the west side of midtown Manhattan. And these questions open up other questions in turn. Why must New York invest so much money, time and energy in the vain pretense that architecture and real estate are the same thing? Wouldn't it be cheaper, not to mention more culturally invigorating, just to put New York back on the map as a center of architectural thought?\n",

      "AS New York's social establishment took their seats at the annual winter gala for the Whitney Museum of American Art, Andre Harrell was perplexed. Sitting beneath a giant orb of white carnations, Mr. Harrell, a rap producer, gazed upon guests like Ronald O. Perelman, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Martha Stewart, and asked: ''What is this about? And what does this have to do with hip-hop?'' Good question. Mr. Harrell, a guest of Russell Simmons of Def Jam Records, had come to hear brief performances by Gloria Gaynor, the disco queen, and Foxy Brown, a teen-age hip-hop sensation, at what was billed as Brite Nite at the Whitney. ''It's probably timely in the sense that hip-hop is becoming mainstream,'' Mr. Harrell said, while Ms. Brown, in an olive micro-minidress that revealed the tattoos on her upper chest, chatted nearby. ''I guess it's a way to take an Upper East Side crowd and make it hip.''\n",

Mr. Clinton is not alone. China's intentions are hard to divine and even its leaders and people cannot be certain what economic, political and military role they will play in the years ahead. But Mr. Clinton and his national security team can be faulted for too often gliding over acts of Chinese belligerence in their determination to improve relations and strengthen commercial ties. As the incidents have accumulated -- among them China's apparent efforts to influence the 1996 American election, its recent crackdown on dissent and its longstanding efforts to steal the most sensitive American military secrets -- the Clinton Administration has sometimes responded weakly. On occasion, it has even abetted Chinese behavior, as in its shortsighted 1996 decision to make it easier for China and other countries to acquire American communications satellites that have potential military applications. When the Administration has firmly defended American interests, as it did earlier in 1996 when China threatened Taiwan, it has nonetheless failed to address the broader pattern of aggressive Chinese conduct.\n",

The names of their businesses covered its facade, and two floors had been added to accommodate more immigrants. Today, after a $40 million restoration, the 17th-century mansion looks nothing like a tenement: Last December, it opened as the new Museum of the Art and History of Judaism. That in itself is no novelty. There are already some 50 Jewish museums in 25 different European countries, and more are expected as former Soviet bloc nations rediscover their Jewish heritage. But the new Paris museum is of special significance, because of this country's moral debt to Jews deported from occupied France to Nazi death camps, because France today has the largest Jewish population in Central and Western Europe, and also because it occupies a stunning building and can boast a treasure of religious and art objects linked to Judaism.\n",

The Institute for Advanced Study is a tower for all and a place of refuge for those who study the world beyond New Jersey for all of us. However, we might take a closer look at Louis Bamberger, whose fortune built the institute. In the 1920's Bamberger's was the third largest department store in the world, exceeded only by Selfridges in London and Marshall Field in Chicago. Bamberger was the founder and owner of L.

And although one might argue that posters are not in the same league as paintings and lithographs, the collection testifies to precisely that dazzling breadth and wit that have made Mr. Hockney, now 61, one of the most popular and admired of contemporary artists. The collection belongs to Brian Baggott, 56, a onetime British Airways employee who first met Mr. Hockney some 30 years ago and has been collecting his posters (as well as silk screens) since the early 70's. Working in group sales for the airline made it easy for him to travel. ''I wrote to every gallery ever mentioned in the back of a Hockney catalogue to see if they'd done a poster,'' Mr. Baggott explained from his south London home.

I was in for a surprise. When I was in college, Mann meant far more to me than neo-classical poets. Today, Mann and his concern, in his early work, with the relationship of the artist to society and of morbidity to genius seem more remote -- even alien -- than Dryden and Pope and their world of clubbable poets and scribbling polemicists. According to an unscientific survey of friends and acquaintances, I'm not alone. Like the Augustans, we live in an age of political pamphleteering, popular drama -- and coffeehouses. In cultural time, A.D. 1999 is closer to 1699 than to 1899 or 1799. This is the result, I think, of a single profound change in Western culture: the recent and abrupt collapse of the Romantic and modernist religion of art, and the marginalization of its central figure, the angelic/demonic Originalgenie. The death of the religion of art is as remarkable as the more or less simultaneous death of Marxism, another secular creed of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n",

      "FROM the day the Monica Lewinsky story burst from the recesses of the Internet into the mainstream press, it has been trailed by a Greek chorus of high-minded journalists and media critics lamenting the saturation coverage of the affair. In their eyes, it has displaced the O. J. Simpson trial as the ultimate symbol of a deplorable trend: the devolution of news into entertainment. As I watched Ms. Lewinsky's interview on ''20/20,'' I could almost hear the chorus mutter: ''It's bad enough we had to pay attention to That Woman when grave questions of state were involved. But now the political crisis is over. Do we have to tolerate not only the inevitable book, but two hours of That Face on television? And can she wipe That Smile off the face, at least?'' For members of the chorus, public fascination with Monica, O. J., Princess Diana, Lorena Bobbitt and their ilk is mere mindless prurience. That respectable news outlets should encourage this fascination signals a catastrophic breakdown of the barrier between serious news, which aims purely to enlighten, and sensational, sleazy tabloid gossip, which aims to titillate its audience and make money for its purveyors. Serious news is about government, business and war. Stories about sex and power, crime and punishment, fame and its pitfalls are ''entertainment'' -- that is, most people find them more exciting than stories about fiscal policy -- and therefore inherently trivial.\n",

She selectively quotes male defenders and female critics, ignoring the many women who shaped the field (Feb. 21). She fabricates a preposterous claim -- that women want a man who can ''maybe dominate them just a little'' -- to inflame her readers, but the claim contradicts the central tenet of evolutionary psychology, that women's and men's emotions serve their partly competing interests. Angier garbles the claim that women's sexual desire is different from men's into the claim that it is puny, warps my explanation of Clinton's behavior into an ''apologia'' and repeatedly takes credit for arguments that her targets have been making for decades.\n",

Among its most distinguished museums are the three National Galleries of Scotland -- the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the National Gallery of Scotland. Starting on March 27, there is to be a fourth, the Dean Gallery, set on landscaped parkland across the street from the Gallery of Modern Art and designed to be a new home for Scottish and European modern art. The new gallery is in an 1833 building that was designed by the architect Thomas Hamilton to house an orphans' hospital; it was later used by the British Government during World War II and then sold to the Edinburgh City Corporation. The three-story building, imposing but simply designed with a Baroque look about it, is essentially to be an extension of the existing Gallery of Modern Art, but will function as a freestanding museum with its own collections. Among these will be a large collection of work by the Scottish sculptor Sir Eduardo Paolozzi, who is known as the founder of British Pop Art and whose eclectic works include figurative and abstract sculptures and collages made from materials like bicycle parts and old musical instruments.\n",

In the prequel, ''Get Shorty'' (made into a hit movie starring John Travolta), Chili, a small-time loan shark from Brooklyn, becomes a Hollywood producer. ''Be Cool'' opens with Chili working on an idea for a new movie. His last film, ''Get Lost,'' was a flop, and Chili thinks he has found a character with potential. She is a young woman named Linda Moon who works for a dating service and sings with a rock band. Chili's way of developing a script is to create a real situation and then see what happens. He takes over Linda Moon's career, and along the way to making her a rock star he encounters a cast of colorful characters, from Russian mobsters to gangster rappers to record industry executives. In an interview conducted by Fletcher Roberts, the pop-music editor of Arts and Leisure, Mr. Leonard, 73, discussed his interest in pop music and its role in the novel.

Dynasty's spacious dining room prompted one diner at our table to remark, ''I have this urge to get up and shoot hoops between courses.'' Dynasty is surprising in other ways. Chinese restaurants opening today are rarely just Chinese. There is usually a sushi bar along one wall and a menu with Thai, Japanese and Korean interlopers. At Dynasty, the only non-Chinese dishes are American: broiled pork chops, steaks, fish and even a fisherman's platter.\n",

      "To the Editor: Concerning Carolyn T. Hughes's review of Richard Panek's ''Seeing and Believing'' (Books in Brief, Feb. 14), it is certainly true that George Ellery Hale was the greatest telescope builder of all time. He was also a manic-depressive who had several nervous breakdowns. But it is a complete myth that he thought he was visited by an elf who spoke to him. This statement first appeared in an otherwise excellent biography of Hale, ''Explorer of the Universe'' (1966), by Helen Wright, who misinterpreted one letter Hale wrote to Hugh F. Newall, an astronomer friend in England. In reality, Hale's ''demon'' (the word he actually used) was a metaphor, referring either to his conscience or to his depressed mood (like Winston Churchill's ''black dog''), and certainly not an apparition. Nevertheless, the ''elf'' has taken on a life of its own in the history of astronomy, referred to not only by Panek but in several other books and on television programs from PBS shows to ''The X-Files.''

It happened last week when Mr. Bruno, previously an advocate of cutbacks in welfare and health care for the poor, proposed a tax break for low-income workers. It would be paid for by savings that have resulted from the drop in welfare rolls. The idea makes particular sense because it would reward, among others, precisely those people who managed to get low-paying jobs after being on welfare. Mr. Bruno's proposal would let working people who earn less than $30,000 keep more of their earnings. Even more attractive, it would give a cash refund to working families making less than $14,000, who pay no income tax at all. This payment, known as the earned-income tax credit, was a centerpiece of President Clinton's tax initiative of 1993. It has turned out to be one of the most successful anti-poverty programs of recent years.\n",

Elizabeth Dole is nearing a run for the Presidency, to the delight of many Republican strategists. And Hillary Clinton is -- famously, teasingly -- thinking about the Senate. The part of me that relishes a cinematic plot turn in real life loves the very idea. These are, after all, perfect big-screen story lines. In this President Dole story, Bob would be self-sacrificing husband, consigned to wistful observation of his wife's rising star -- because, hey, it's her turn now. In the Senator Clinton story, Hillary would be the girl scorned in high school who shows up at her reunion in splendor, humbling her old tormentors and winning a seat on the Appropriations Committee while ''I Will Survive'' crescendos on the soundtrack. You'd have to be a killjoy of the dourest hue not to see the fun in it. And I'm not, really. But I was a teen-ager in the 70's. And it's in the spirit of that era's egalitarian feminism -- the very one in which Hillary Clinton, cosmetic-free Yale law student, came of intellectual age -- that I find this latest brand of political dynasticism lamentable. Sure, that period produced some risible cultural flotsam, but its emphasis on female autonomy and possibility was bracing. (Still, I drew the line at gynecological self-examination courses.) That sensibility is precisely what's missing from the new wifeocracy, in which a woman's own political career is an outgrowth of her husband's.\n"

This is a tall order for any curator, as is all too apparent in the current exhibition at the Paramount Center for the Arts tilted ''Architectonics.'' Ms. Fishman's own work, when seen in the context of this show, is the exhibition's most diverse. As the curator, however, she has chosen too many artists that produce works comparable to hers, thus reducing her presence in the show to a mere distraction. For instance, Annie W. Small's two humorously titled, flip-flop patternings of architectural details titled ''Arboresque'' (1991) and ''Cornercopia'' utilize the same technique, and with results similar to Ms. Fishman's photographic collage ''Portland Construction'' (1997). Ms. Fishman also photographs antiquity in her Cibachrome titled ''Library at Ephesus'' (1998), though a more exquisite example of this type is the silver print ''La Rocca'' (1994) by Renata Rainer, and the Modernist look in Ms. Fishman's triptych ''Stadium, Athens'' (1998) pales in comparison to Barry Winiker's three efforts, ''Regency Cruises' Regent Sun'' (1991), ''Costa Cruises' Costa Riviera'' (1990) and ''Bahama Cruise Lines' Veracruz'' (1984).\n",

The layers are so thin that even after applying several coats, the total thickness of all the layers together is less than an eighth of an inch. Skim-coating can also be used to smooth a textured surface. Skim-coating does not require any arcane skills. It is a matter of troweling on the coating, then spreading it thin with a wide, drywall taping knife. The job, however, is time-consuming; it will take three four days to skim-coat the walls of an average-sized room. It is also rather tedious.\n",

Imbedded in this list is his observation that the senior composers -- the Babbitts, the Carters and the Perles -- have given up their claim to be authoritative. Translation: these composers have given up their claim to a place in the canon of western classical music.\n",

''El Greco, Identity and Transformation'' features 70 of his works, including 11 paintings that have never before been part of an El Greco exhibition. Domenikos Theotocopoulos became known as El Greco (The Greek) after he moved to Spain in 1577.

From his Italian period there are ''The Modena Triptych'' from 1569, depicting the life of Christ, on loan from an Italian museum, and the ''Adoration of the Shepherds,'' circa 1570, on loan from a private English collection.\n",

The green pastures of the Alps lent themselves to dairying, and cheese was preserved throughout the winter months. Scores of vineyards, which climbed the sunny Alpine slopes, produced an abundance of fine wines. Bread was made in summer and fall in preparation for the long winter , and it hardened so quickly it had to be dunked in liquid to be chewable.\n",

      "INDULGENCES? SOUNDS LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY FROM HISTORY CLASS That's because they were most notorious in the 16th century -- or about halfway through the second semester. They're meant as a way for Catholics to reduce their debt to God, which people build up through sin (and which they otherwise must work off through penance or, later, in Purgatory). To earn these indulgences, worshipers had to perform special prayers, make pilgrimages or undertake acts of personal sacrifice. DIDN'T THEY CAUSE A WHOLE MESS OF TROUBLE THE LAST TIME AROUND? During the Renaissance, the Catholic Church started actually selling indulgences, for cash, to wealthy patrons. That move didn't go over very well with critics like Martin Luther, who called them frauds of the faithful. In fact, they were a big part of what caused him to break with the Church -- and thereby launch the Protestant Reformation. THEN WHY DOES THE VATICAN WANT TO BRING THEM BACK? To celebrate the millennium. Selling them was forbidden in 1563, but indulgences themselves -- though increasingly marginalized -- were never officially disallowed. In celebration of the year 2000, which has been declared a holy year, the Vatican has chosen to promote them once again. SO WILL LOURDES BE THE NEXT HOT SPOT? It's not out of the question. After all, medieval religious rituals have become surprisingly fashionable -- most notably cabalistic Judaism, the darling of movie stars and models. And in a move that will make this arcane tradition more appealing, the requirements have been updated -- even ''abstaining for at least one whole day from unnecessary consumption (e.g. from smoking or alcohol)'' is said to lessen your stay in Purgatory if you donate your drink money to charity. SO YOU CAN GET TO HEAVEN MORE QUICKLY BY GIVING UP SMOKING? And you thought it would get you there more slowly. Religious folk of every stripe are trying to make devotion more relevant to everyday life, and the Catholic Church is no exception. In this case, however, some people think the project might be going a bit too far. ''Offering indulgences for giving up smoking,'' says the Rev. Richard McBrien of the University of Notre Dame, ''is like offering indulgences for not drinking poison.'' Andrew Santella\n",

The Goernment based its study on an analysis of assessed property value and market value for more than 11,000 residential properties sold in Nassau between August 1, 1995, and July 31, 1996. It then compared the results with the latest demographic data available from the Census Bureau. The analysis, broken down by census tract in two maps accompanying the study, showed a strong correlation between race and the property assessment rate, according to Zachary W. Carter, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. On avaerage, he said, the assessment rate in predominantly minority tracts was 27 percent higher than the average rate for all property in Nassau. JOHN T. MCQUISTON\n",

A sophisticated woman with a wide range of cultural interests, Ms. Mattlage's career took her from modern dance with Jose Limon, and Doris Humphrey, to director and choreographer of her own dance company, based in CT, called The Dancers of Faith. The Dance Company performed in countless churches and synagogues throughout the eastern United States. She taught modern dance at college and universities all around the world. She was the author of four books of poetry. Her numerous poems and essays were published in periodicals often concerning women's issues. Born and raised in Boston, MA, Ms. Mattlage lived for many years in Fairfield and Southport, CT. She moved to Key Biscayne, FL in 1971. She continued to spend summers in Fairfield, CT. She was a member of the Miami chapter of the Pen Women and she lectured and performed her dance and poetry well into her 80's. In 1989, she moved to Boca Raton, FL. She is survived by her son Jonathan Mattlage of Acworth, GA, her daughter Valerie Mattlage of Boca Raton, FL, and her two grandsons: Jason Ledyard, of New York, NY, and Jonathan Mattlage, Jr. of Kennesaw, GA.

This (who could forget?) was the dark, austere object that arrived in the midst of primitive ape-men. It drove them into a state of high anxiety as they rallied around the thing, touched it, recoiled, tried to fathom it, sensed its intense power without quite grasping what that power might mean. The arrival of each new mind-blowing Kubrick film was much the same. Kubrick's small (only eight films after 1960) but amazingly varied body of work was unified not only by bizarre brilliance but also by its rare ability to disturb. He anticipated, even prophesied, all manner of assaults on the soul of mankind, and he gave voice to its most insidious fears, about the corruption of ''vital bodily fluids'' and so much worse. From the stylized amoral thugs of ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1971) to the brutalizing military discipline of ''Full Metal Jacket'' (1987) and the rogue technology of ''2001'' (1968), he sensed profound menace even when he satirized it with that diabolical, priceless ''Strangelove'' glee.\n",

His co-defendants cheered and ultimately, he was the only one of 13 men on trial to be set free. But last month, Mr. Murillo's name surfaced again, as Federal prosecutors filed two new indictments against 27 suspected members of la Eme (so named for the Spanish pronunciation of the letter M). That time, however, Mr. Murillo was a murder victim.\n",

To Warburg Dillon Read, the investment banking business of UBS A.G. of Switzerland, which was struggling to bolster its presence in the United States, the answer was Benjamin Lorello, a Salomon Smith Barney health care banker. Mr. Lorello left for Warburg after being offered more than $50 million in salary and bonuses over three years and about $25 million in deferred stock benefits. That huge price tag may say less about Mr. Lorello than the desire of his new employer to crack the global health care industry. The Europeans have largely failed in recent attempts to expand in America. In 1998, Deutsche Bank retreated from Wall Street, only a few years after paying hefty hiring incentives.

Mr. Agca, who is serving a life sentence in an Italian prison in Ancona, has repeatedly asked the Pope and the Italian Government for release or extradition to Turkey. The Pope forgave Mr. Agca for the attempt on his life, but the Vatican has always emphasized that any decision about his sentence is up to the Italian Government. Tonight President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro told reporters that he might agree to allow Mr. Agca to return to Turkey. ''Since so many years have passed,'' he said, ''I don't think it would be a difficult case.''\n",

Water marketing -- capping the total amount of water that can be used during a particular period of time, and selling or trading rights to use it -- is a good way to manage water use. Under this policy, market prices signal the relative scarcity of water, while graduated price increases alert consumers of the need to conserve water.\n",

Which has garnered the most column inches in the press, the most hours on television, and by far the most enthusiastic reviews? No, the answer is not some striking drama at the National or a searing satire at the Royal Court. It has been a defiantly undemonstrative, unpretentiously devastating piece called ''The Color of Justice'' that opened in January in the little Tricycle Theater in the unfashionable North London area of Kilburn and went on to replace a revival of ''Annie'' at a 1,500-seat theater in the West End, where it ended its run yesterday. It has been a startling phenomenon, given that the subject was the murder of a quiet teen-ager in an obscure corner of Southeast London way back in 1993, and yet it isn't an altogether surprising one. Nothing in 1999 has kept British reporters, pundits and editorial writers busier than a long-awaited, much-leaked and now officially published report into the aftermath of the killing of an 18-year-old whose only known offense was to have been born black.\n",

''I needed Clinton to see me as his defender, not his interrogator, which made me, of course, an enabler,'' he writes in his new memoir, ''All Too Human.'' Ambivalence and regret are the two main emotional chords in the book, but in this case Mr. Stephanopoulos seems to be beating himself up unnecessarily. Throughout American history, when a bimbo eruption has hit an American Presidential campaign, the last thing a candidates' aides have considered doing is asking the Big Guy for the real story. When Grover Cleveland was accused of having an illegitimate child, he ordered his advisers to ''tell the truth'' and went off to sulk for the rest of the campaign. Nobody ran after him to ask exactly what the truth was supposed to be. Mr. Stephanopoulos's treatment of the Clintons seems pretty evenhanded, even though, like almost everyone connected to the Clintons who did not leave the Administration under indictment, he left clutching a prescription for anti-depressants. ''All Too Human'' is not the sort of book that is going to make the younger generation yearn for a career as White House communications director.\n",

Established members of society -- doctors, lawyers and World War I military heroes -- they could not conceive of themselves as outcasts, let alone as targets for mass murder. Their first feeling, then, was one of profound disorientation. So it is in Berlin's new Jewish Museum, designed by the American architect Daniel Libeskind. Opened in January, the museum, as yet, has nothing in it. But that does not matter. Indeed the building amounts to such an overpowering architectural sculpture that the biggest problem may prove to be insuring that the exhibits, when they are installed, are not crushed by the power of the rooms they fill.\n",

      "IRVING BERLIN, born Israel Baline, was 5 when his family emigrated from Byelorussia to the United States in 1893 and settled on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. By 1910 he was an established Tin Pan Alley songwriter. The following year, with his first great success, ''Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' his career as America's premier composer and lyricist took off and never seriously faltered for much of the rest of the century. By the time of his death in 1989 at 101, he had moved chameleonlike through the ragtime, jazz and swing eras, absorbing and learning as he went, turning out songs in every conceivable pop style. He had also created some of the most enduring Broadway and movie scores ever written. George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, and Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein all shaped American popular music in their own ways. Yet no single mind mastered as much of the popular American musical idiom, for so long with such an unaffected wit and elegance, as Irving Berlin.\n",

      "TUCKER-Kenneth F., M.D. Prominent psychiatrist of Sutton Place South, New York City, died March 8, 1999 at New York Hospital. A long-time resident of Scarsdale, NY, Dr. Tucker had suffered from kidney failure and heart disease for many years. He was born September 5, 1927 in Brooklyn, NY, to Isaac and Belle Cooperstein Tucker, formerly of Russia. Dr. Tucker was an early graduate of Brooklyn Tech, attended R.P.I., and served with the U.S. Army in the Philippines in 1946-1947. He received a B.S. in Chemistry from Columbia and graduated from Cornell Medical School in 1953. From that time until his death, Dr. Tucker conducted a private practice in psychiatry in the same office on Sutton Place. Long affilated with Payne Whitney, he was an early researcher in the use of chemicals to treat mental illness. During his distinguished career, he was a valued counselor to many prominent people and a source of wisdom, comfort and joy to all who had the good fortune to know him. Dr. Tucker was also a life-long sports fan; his first job, at fourteen, was selling programs at Ebbetts Field, for which he was paid $2 a day. At sixteen, he was a member of the New York All-City Championship Handball Team. In later years, he would often return to the handball courts at Coney Island to reminisce about his year of glory. Over his life time, he grew to forgive the New York Yankees for not having been situated in Brooklyn, and his emotional health rose and fell with the fortunes of his beloved New York Giants. Dr. Tucker was proud of his Jewish heritage and raised his children in his faith. Dr Tucker was also a reader of great acuity, breadth and curiosity; he triumphed weekly over the most difficult crosswords; his sense of humor was that of a true New Yorker. He married the late Barbara Irving in 1957. They had four children: Douglas Tucker, of Berkeley, CA, a forensic psychiatrist, Duane Tucker, of New York City, a database administrator, Holly Tucker, of Berkeley, CA, a research administrator and Randolph Tucker, a lawyer, of Ojai, CA. In 1991, Dr. Tucker married Amy Ellis Tucker, of Bronxville, NY, who survives him. He is also loved and survived by three grandchildren, Sam, Alan and Barbara Tucker of Ojai, CA, a sister Gertrude Tucker Weker, of Bethesda, MD; (his other sister, Evelyn Tucker Feinstein, pre-deceased him); a niece, Laurie Weker Lipton, of Rockville, MD, and four nephews, Richard Feinstein of Cranston, RI, Lester Feinstein of Littleton, CO, Jonathan Weker of Montpelier, VT and Robert Weker, of Wynnewood, PA. Contributions in Dr. Tucker's name may be made to the Cornell University Medical College, Department of Psychiatry.\n",

Every Bronx High School of Science graduate knows that litmus is a paper covered with the coloring matter from lichens that stays blue when dipped in an alkaline solution and turns pink when dipped in an acid solution. (Or is it the other way around? I did poorly in chemistry, but got through because the kid next to me, who ultimately won a Nobel Prize, let me crib. Some may call that cheating; we called it ''helping a flunking friend,'' a Value that needs Restoring.) That scientific meaning of litmus test has been extended to ''a criterion that overwhelms all others.'' To get an illustrative usage of this, I just used my mouse to highlight the phrase and punched the dictionary symbol on my Microsoft QuickShelf. Here's what came up: ''The word 'hopefully' has become the litmus test to determine whether one is a language snob or a language slob -- William Safire.''

Born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, he immigrated to the United States in 1973 after serving in the Israeli army. He studied fine art, his love, at the Maryland Institute College of Art and moved to New York in 1977 to study architecture and design. He designed and renovated many residential and commercial spaces in Manhattan and eventually formed his own company to develop and restore city properties. Fine art remained his first love. In 1996, after a long fight with cancer during which he received a kidney from his mother, he opened the Ice Gallery, dedicated to promoting non-conceptual 20th Century art. He sponsored several artists whose work represented what he considered to be traditional values, and he worked with the Maryland Institute College of Art to begin an exchange program for art students in the United States and Israel. His mother, Elizabeth Dagani-Cohen, and a brother, Eitan Cohen, survive him. Both reside in Tel Aviv. Mr. Cohen will be interred at the Mount of Olives Cemetery in Israel. Friends may pay their last respects at a memorial service to be held at the Ice Gallery on Monday, March 15 at 7:30 PM.

Eventually viewers grew accustomed to seeing what was invisible to the eye and counted it as a kind of miracle. Conventions created by the camera were accepted: blur signified speed, and a stroboscopic series of figures in a single frame indicated motion, although if the eye takes in blur and such tiny increments of motion, it does not register them.\n",

      "The Boys of My Youth By Jo Ann Beard. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13. These 12 essays about the author's largely uneventful upbringing in the Midwest and her marriage and divorce are brought to life by her comfortable voice and acerbic powers of observation. ''Beard remembers (or imagines) her childhood with an uncanny lucidity that startles,'' Laura Miller wrote in the Book Review last year. Wicked Women: Stories By Fay Weldon. Atlantic Monthly, $12. With 21 novels and 3 short-story collections, the author has perfected her ironic forays into the universe of the discarded wife who is forced into heroic self-awareness -- this time out she also takes aim at insecure househusbands, selfish adult children, therapists and the culture's infatuation with New Age blather. ''She is a Yahweh with a profound appreciation of irony,'' Deborah Mason wrote in these pages in 1997. ''Weldon has become one of the most cunning moral satirists of our time. In her rueful stories, justice is done -- whether we like it or not.'' Caucasia By Danzy Senna. Riverhead, $12.95. This first novel tracks the coming of age of the daughter of a white activist and a black intellectual who struggles to find her identity in a harsh and confusing world. ''Senna superbly illustrates the emotional toll that politics and race take on one especially gutsy young girl's development,'' Elizabeth Schmidt said here in 1998. The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia By Tim Judah. Yale University, $16. A journalist argues that the Serbs have been subjected to ''ethnic cleansing'' since medieval times, making it the driving force behind their national consciousness, and he links the recent atrocities committed by the Bosnian Serbs to a collective madness prompted by a desire for revenge. In 1997 our reviewer, Aleksa Djilas, called this ''a lively and balanced history.'' Yale has also reissued Croatia: A Nation Forged in War, by Marcus Tanner ($16), which focuses on a Balkan culture with a bewildering web of influences and contradictions -- not to mention a long tradition of close relations with Serbia. The book is ''written with vigor, full of absorbing stories and important insights,'' Djilas wrote here, also in 1997. The Knife Thrower and Other Stories By Steven Millhauser. Vintage Contemporaries, $12. The dreamers, inventors, artists and illusionists who populate these tales don't know when to stop. The author reveals ''splendid flashes of absurdity and satire'' and a ''rich, sly sense of humor'' as he explores our complex response to ''the products and projections of our own minds,'' Patrick McGrath said in these pages in 1998. Cagney By John McCabe. Carroll & Graf, $14.95. Cagney the man was hardly the tough guy and ebullient showman he portrayed on screen: he was a retiring sort with surprisingly refined tastes, the former ghostwriter of his autobiography maintains. This ''revealing biography'' exceeds ''the half-dozen previous books on the actor at illuminating the private Cagney,'' David Hajdu wrote here in 1997. Another iconic entertainer is profiled in Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W. C. Fields, by Simon Louvish (Norton, $18), which recalls the actor's early vaudevillian career as a world-class pantomime juggler and does its best to sift through the ''acres of flamboyant flim-flam'' that obscured his past. ''Besides proffering anecdotes, Louvish does a heroic job of filling in Fields's life,'' Katharine Whittemore said here in 1997. The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton By Jane Smiley. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12.95. The spunky 20-year-old narrator blossoms into a committed abolitionist when she and her husband journey to the Kansas Territory in the 1850's and are forced to cope with hardscrabble prairie life and nasty proslavers. Until it lapses into a ''feminist revenge fantasy,'' the novel is ''consistently entertaining, filled with action and ideas,'' Thomas Mallon wrote here last year. The Edith Wharton Murders By Lev Raphael. St. Martin's, $11.95. The moderator of a conference of hostile Wharton scholars at a Michigan university turns reluctant sleuth when a celebrated author turns up dead. The result is a ''maliciously funny campus mystery'' that satirizes ''the intellectual jealousies and political rivalries . . . in academic communities,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote here in 1997. Brassa: Letters to My Parents Translated by Peter Laki and Barna Kantor. University of Chicago, $16. The Hungarian-born photographer Brassa (1899-1984) recounts in exuberant fashion his efforts to support himself as an aspiring young artist in Berlin and Paris. In 1997 in these pages, Christine Schwartz Hartley called this a ''delightful volume'' that is ''rich in anecdotes.'' Night of Many Dreams By Gail Tsukiyama. St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95. This novel centers on two sisters from Hong Kong growing up during and after World War II and the family rituals that bind them. Last year our reviewer, Bill Kent, admired the ''evocative scenes of a wonderfully unexotic, warmheartedly domestic Hong Kong.'' Scott Veale\n",

But it certainly has everything else a smoker could desire.

Only twice in 96 years had Crayola changed a color's name, rechristening ''Prussian blue'' as ''midnight blue'' in 1958 because people had lost track of exactly what Prussia was, and changing ''flesh'' to ''peach'' in 1962, recognizing that flesh is a many-colored thing. Now it will relabel ''indian red'' to wipe out any associations with Native Americans. The new name? Ideas are welcome. HUBERT B. HERRING\n",

      "EMBLAZONED on the National Theater's latest brochure is the face of a wise-looking playwright with a seriously retreating hairline. But, no, it isn't William Shakespeare. It's Noel Coward, the centenary of whose birth we British are celebrating this year. A statue of the Master, as his acolytes called him, was recently unveiled. His two best plays, ''Private Lives'' and ''Hay Fever,'' are about to get revivals in the city through whose streets he sauntered with hat, cane and debonair air. Other Coward work is likely to follow. But more of the Master, David Hare and assorted moderns in a moment. The oddity is that, if one were to choose a yet more representative face to embellish a brochure for the British theater as a whole in the next few months, it would be Shakespeare, whose 435th birthday will be celebrated on April 23. Anyone adventurous or masochistic enough to spend the whole of the long lukewarm summer in London could take in Trevor Nunn's and John Caird's staging of Shakespeare's anti-romantic tragicomedy about love and war, ''Troilus and Cressida,'' which starts a long run at the National Theater tomorrow; ''The Merchant of Venice,'' at the same playhouse, begins June 17; ''Julius Caesar,'' ''The Comedy of Errors'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra'' in the copy of Shakespeare's Globe on Bankside begin previews on May 13, May 28 and July 24, respectively; Paul Rhys, the rising young star, appears as Hamlet at the Young Vic from April 7 to May 15, and anyone who doesn't mind risking a drenching can go to the cozy Open Air Theater in Regents Park for ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' and ''Twelfth Night,'' both of which open in the first week of June.\n",

      "Reticence and iconoclasm have always made an alluring combination, but Rei Kawakubo has honed them to an art. Loath to make pronouncements, she lets her Comme des Gar-->ons designs do the talking -- and even though they never speak the party line, the fashion world listens. Long acknowledged as a member of that very small club, the true avant-garde, Kawakubo is consistently provocative without resorting to sensationalism. So when she shows clothes made of laser-cut synthetic fabrics attached to what looks like unfinished patterns, or unveils an ''abstract antiperfume'' made from totally inorganic materials (to evoke burned rubber rather than roses), fashion aficionados know that Kawakubo is simply following her deconstructive instincts, which always place her ahead of the curve. And not just in fashion. Kawakubo, whose store interiors are just as idiosyncratic and carefully considered as her clothing, has trumped the rest of the high-end retail pack with her latest venture. After spending 15 years in a spare, open space in SoHo, Kawakubo has fled that neighborhood's upscale-shopping-mall atmosphere for the untested environs of Chelsea. The only store of its ilk in a neighborhood recently pioneered by art galleries that have migrated north, Comme des Gar-->ons is utterly new, yet vintage Kawakubo.\n",

If a small slam is a 50-50 proposition, somebody is sure to be lucky and somebody else unlucky. One exception is the par competition in which players must cope with prepared deals. Another is the post-mortem, in which quick analysis is required.

The way the Vienna Philharmonic's mellifluous violins and plaintive woodwinds caressed the music's spare, grieving melodic lines made this elusive work seem newly powerful: Shostakovich takes us to deep, painful places here, but the Vienna Philharmonic was there to hold our hands and make it safe.\n",

When he sang, his voice jumped into a higher register, the way an automatic transmission might, unexpectedly. Mr. Galindo was singing at Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture in the Bronx on Saturday night, and everything he did suggested that the ecstatic moment was rippling away under a surface that already wasn't particularly tranquil. Mr. Galindo is the lead singer in Adalberto Alvarez's band. They're from Cuba; and when Mr. Galindo danced, he tossed everything he knew together, religious, sexual and popular dance moves, and it was gloriously rhythmic and chaotic, but graciously so. He's oddly charismatic, and powerful. And his voice conveyed a sense of delirium that is unusual in the music; it fit perfectly with the machinelike onslaught of the band.\n",

For much of this afternoon's second-round National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament game in the Midwest Regional, Cleaves, the all-America guard for top-seeded Michigan State, played in desultory fashion against ninth-seeded Mississippi. Cleaves had been racking up nearly as many turnovers as points at the Bradley Center. Mississippi led by 3 at the half, and Cleaves had 8 points and 5 turnovers. And with less than five minutes to play, Cleaves, a 6-foot-2-inch junior who is built as solidly as a beer keg, was embarrassed when the player he was guarding, the 5-5 Jason Harrison, drilled a 3-point shot at the shot-clock buzzer to break a tie.\n",

      "In the name of sanity, can someone please stop that noise? All those chuckles, titters, giggles, guffaws: they're so much scarier than the usual shrieks, groans and clanking chains. Such are the diabolical, synthetic sounds of amusement that plague the sunny but definitely haunted beach house of ''Betty's Summer Vacation,'' an ecstatically angry new comedy by Christopher Durang that suggests that Western civilization is ending not with a bang but with a laugh track. Horrendous acts from rape to dismemberment occur in this relentlessly fierce, relentlessly funny story of a summer rental for which the word ''nightmare'' is gentle. But the truly unpardonable crime in this world of the comedy, which opened last night at Playwrights Horizons in a heavenly hell of a production directed by Nicholas Martin, is silence, which means boredom. The unseen spirits of the laugh track, who can find plenty of amusement in stories of incest and wife beating, don't like it when things get quiet. Fortunately for them, that doesn't happen very often. That's fortunate for us, too.\n",

He will be missed by his many friends at the Museum, and we extend our deepest condolences to his wife Frances and their children and grandchildren. Ronald S.

The International Olympic Committee ought to keep that in mind as its members gather this week in Switzerland to determine how much to reform their discredited organization. The answer is a lot. If it wishes to survive as the custodian of the Olympics, the I.O.C. must transform itself, discarding the clubby, self-indulgent traditions that tolerated corruption. Instead of operating with an arrogance and secrecy that the Soviet Politburo would have envied, the I.O.C. must do business openly and democratically. That means establishing and scrupulously following corruption-proof criteria for the selection of host cities. The best way to insulate the selection process may be to have an impartial panel of experts on sports facilities nominate two finalists on which the I.O.C. would vote.\n",

The former official, Mary Schiavo, said her aim was to help a local television station prepare a story about security, not to disrupt operations at the airport. The airport police evacuated a concourse at Port Columbus airport, ordering hundreds of travelers from the area, and planes were pushed back from their gates. The bomb squad took the bag to a spot on the north runway and closed the runway for five hours. The F.B.I. and the Federal Aviation Administration have joined the investigation.\n",

''Many major corporations still play things straight, but a significant and growing number of otherwise high-grade managers -- C.E.O.'s you would be happy to have as spouses for your children or as trustees under your will -- have come to the view that it's O.K. to manipulate earnings to satisfy what they believe are Wall Street's desires,'' Mr. Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 report.

The Adams is a major work if only in size: the first movement lasts 20 minutes, the entire piece more than twice that time. The title is taken from the thoughts of Schiller, and Mr. Adams in response to them sends out a simple tune on a long excursion. At some points along the way, sense and sensibility exist unconsciously as one and the same (naive). At others, thought and spirit have been separated, and the artist struggles to mend the rift (sentimental).\n",

Lewis was clearly the superior fighter for most of a dreary evening, and one judge actually awarded him the fight. A second judge called it a draw while a third, astonishingly, gave it to Holyfield. Holyfield and Lewis will continue to share the title. The only clear winners were the promoters, who will stage a rematch in six months. This bout was supposed to be a big shot in the arm for boxing in New York -- a fight that would establish one clear champion in the heavyweight division and bring back the glory days of Madison Square Garden. When it ended the way it did, the state's leading politicians were furious and not a bit bashful about raising the possibility of fraud. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who watched the bout on television along with more than a million others who paid $50 for the privilege, called the result a ''travesty'' that could lead reasonable people to conclude that ''someone had altered the honest judgment of the judges.'' Gov. George Pataki ordered an inquiry by the State Athletic Commission, while Eliot Spitzer, the State Attorney General, began a separate inquiry.

Augusto Pinochet of Chile is whether Washington aided in the 1973 military coup that brought him to power and how much it knew of the murders and forced disappearances committed by his Government. Beginning with an investigation by a Senate committee in 1975, tantalizing bits of information have emerged about failed Central Intelligence Agency efforts to keep the Socialist Salvador Allende from becoming president of Chile in 1970, and the C.I.A.'s ties to Mr. Pinochet's intelligence organizations. Now, if the Clinton Administration carries out a well-designed plan to declassify its information on Chile, the details of America's role may be known. The Administration ordered the review because of a surge of interest in Mr. Pinochet that developed after his indictment last year by a Spanish court. The plan was released to the public at the prodding of the National Security Archive, a non-governmental group. It directs the State, Defense and Justice Departments, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council to search their files for information on human rights abuses and terrorism in Chile, beginning with the period from 1968 to 1978. The directive asks the agencies to complete their initial release of documents by mid-May. All documents will be treated as if they were more than 25 years old, making them much easier to declassify.\n",

How could that be when Russia, Europe's largest country, is excluded? Anti-Russian analysts are quick to overlook the fact that Russia had inquired about membership in the alliance before Poland. How would the Poles like it if Russia were entering NATO and Poland was left out? MICHAEL AVERKO Malverne Park, N.Y., March 12, 1999\n",

Casey, a longtime National Basketball Association assistant, was named the Nets' head coach on an interim basis in the wake of yesterday's firing of John Calipari. It is the second time Casey has been in such a position but his first time -- with the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989 -- was a hopeless situation. This time, Casey has great talent to work with.\n",

      "When the blue pike began to disappear from Lake Erie in the 1950's, it took with it a major regional fishery and a cornerstone of the Friday fish fry, a thriving culinary institution in the heavily Catholic towns and cities that line the lake shore in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. Other fish filled in once the blue pike was gone -- it was declared extinct in 1975, when the Great Lakes themselves seemed moribund -- but nothing really replaced it. It is odd to think that no one under the age of 45 is likely to remember tasting blue pike, though it was a staple of their parents' diet and a vital element in their parents' religious observance. Now, after a long search, scientists have found a well-preserved specimen of blue pike whose DNA will allow them to judge whether the claims of blue pike sightings in other lakes are true. The specimen was kept for decades in the freezer of Jim Anthony, a barber in Conneaut, Ohio. Nearly every serious fisherman finds a long-forgotten fish in the freezer now and then, but Mr. Anthony -- a man as persistent as he is sentimental -- caught his blue pike in 1962 and has preserved it ever since. A frozen blue pike is even rarer than a living coelacanth, a prehistoric fish once thought to be extinct but which has been caught from time to time in the Comoros archipelago.\n",

Mr. Wheeldon, who trained in England and dances with the New York City Ballet, does seem drawn to the rich resources of pure ballet classicism. His quietly authoritative new ''Corybantic Ecstasies,'' created for the Boston Ballet and performed by the company at the Shubert Theater here this afternoon, follows the suite structure beloved of young modern-dance choreographers these days. But there is not a Graham contraction or Limon fall and recovery in sight in this ballet idyll. Set to Leonard Bernstein's full-throttle Serenade, ''Corybantic Ecstasies'' begins with the sound of sweet string music. The curtain rises to reveal a handsome backdrop of panels between which stand four entwining couples seen in silhouette. The Greek god Eros (Patrick Armand) dances onto the stage, gradually drawing out the men and women in dancing that seamlessly juxtaposes his tight, explosive energy with their pretty elegance. Echo (Tara Hench) and Narcissus (Simon Ball) are next, in a trio in which Echo is left on her own when Narcissus and his silvery mirror image (Zachary Hench) become fixated with each other.\n",

The Dow closed at 9,958.77, up 82.42 points, and the S.& P. closed up 12.67 at 1,307.26. The Nasdaq composite index failed to set a new high but was the session's best-performing index.

Questions about Mr. Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion because he is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in Birmingham, Ala., and one in the Atlanta area, and because he was last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville.\n",

      "With just a year to go before high school students must pass a tough new English Regents test to graduate, New York State education officials released test results yesterday showing that more than a quarter of all seniors -- and more than a third of those in New York City -- would have failed if the requirement had been in place last year. The outcome made little difference to those students, because they were able to graduate with non-Regents diplomas. But this year's 11th graders will have to pass the English Regents this year or next with a score of 55 or better. And the new version of the test, to be given for the first time this June, will be harder, lasting six hours over two days and putting more emphasis on analytical writing.\n",

      "All things considered, the Rangers probably got about what they deserved last night at Madison Square Garden when they tied the Washington Capitals, 1-1. Weary from a busy schedule, the Rangers failed to hold a lead, but survived to gain 1 point in the standings in the race for the final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference. Over all, it was a forgettable game with a frantic overtime period and a few memorable moments before it. One was the first National Hockey League goal for Rumun Ndur, a Ranger rookie defenseman. Another was what might be the final Garden appearance for Washington's Dale Hunter, a veteran bully-boy who played the villain's role as usual in a scrappy performance. And the Rangers got another sharp performance from goalie Mike Richter, who stopped 33 of 34 shots.\n",
